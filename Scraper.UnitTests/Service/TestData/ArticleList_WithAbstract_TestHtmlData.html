                            We propose temporal Poisson square root graphical models (TPSQRs), a
                            generalization of Poisson square root graphical models (PSQRs) specifically
                            designed for modeling longitudinal event data. By estimating the temporal
                            relationships for all possible pairs of event types, TPSQRs can offer a
                            holistic perspective about whether the occurrences of any given event type
                            could excite or inhibit any other type. A TPSQR is learned by estimating a
                            collection of interrelated PSQRs that share the same template parameterization.
                            These PSQRs are estimated jointly in a pseudo-likelihood fashion, where Poisson
                            pseudo-likelihood is used to approximate the original more
                            computationally-intensive pseudo-likelihood problem stemming from PSQRs.
                            Theoretically, we demonstrate that under mild assumptions, the Poisson
                            pseudo-likelihood approximation is sparsistent for recovering the underlying
                            PSQR. Empirically, we learn TPSQRs from Marshfield Clinic electronic health
                            records (EHRs) with millions of drug prescription and condition diagnosis
                            events, for adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection. Experimental results
                            demonstrate that the learned TPSQRs can recover ADR signals from the EHR
                            effectively and efficiently.

                            Bitcoin represents one of the most interesting technological breakthroughs
                            and socio-economic experiments of the last decades. In this paper, we examine
                            the role of speculative bubbles in the process of Bitcoin's technological
                            adoption by analyzing its social dynamics. We trace Bitcoin's genesis and
                            dissect the nature of its techno-economic innovation. In particular, we present
                            an analysis of the techno-economic feedback loops that drive Bitcoin's price
                            and network effects. Based on our analysis of Bitcoin, we test and further
                            refine the Social Bubble Hypothesis, which holds that bubbles constitute an
                            essential component in the process of technological innovation. We argue that a
                            hierarchy of repeating and exponentially increasing series of bubbles and hype
                            cycles, which has occurred over the past decade since its inception, has
                            bootstrapped Bitcoin into existence.

                            Regions of Interest (ROI) contain morphological features in pathology whole
                            slide images (WSI) are delimited with polygons[1]. These polygons are often
                            represented in either a textual notation (with the array of edges) or in a
                            binary mask form. Textual notations have an advantage of human readability and
                            portability, whereas, binary mask representations are more useful as the input
                            and output of feature-extraction pipelines that employ deep learning
                            methodologies. For any given whole slide image, more than a million cellular
                            features can be segmented generating a corresponding number of polygons. The
                            corpus of these segmentations for all processed whole slide images creates
                            various challenges for filtering specific areas of data for use in interactive
                            real-time and multi-scale displays and analysis. Simple range queries of image
                            locations do not scale and, instead, spatial indexing schemes are required. In
                            this paper we propose using Hilbert Curves simultaneously for spatial indexing
                            and as a polygonal ROI representation. This is achieved by using a series of
                            Hilbert Curves[2] creating an efficient and inherently spatially-indexed
                            machine-usable form. The distinctive property of Hilbert curves that enables
                            both mask and polygon delimitation of ROIs is that the elements of the vector
                            extracted ro describe morphological features maintain their relative positions
                            for different scales of the same image.

                            Reachability analysis is a fundamental program analysis with a wide variety
                            of applications. We present FlowCFL, a framework for type-based reachability
                            analysis in the presence of mutable data. Interestingly, the underlying
                            semantics of FlowCFL is CFL-reachability.
                            <br />We make three contributions. First, we define a dynamic semantics that
                            captures the notion of flow commonly used in reachability analysis. Second, we
                            establish correctness of CFL-reachability over graphs with inverse edges
                            (inverse edges are necessary for the handling of mutable heap data). Our
                            approach combines CFL-reachability with reference immutability to avoid the
                            addition of certain infeasible inverse edges and we demonstrate empirically
                            that avoiding those edges results in precision improvement. Our formal account
                            of correctness extends to this case as well. Third, we present a type-based
                            reachability analysis and establish equivalence between a certain
                            CFL-reachability analysis and the type-based analysis, thus proving correctness
                            of the type-based analysis.

                            A distributed computing system is a collection of processors that communicate
                            either by reading and writing from a shared memory or by sending messages over
                            some communication network. Most prior biologically inspired distributed
                            computing algorithms rely on message passing as the communication model. Here
                            we show that in the process of genome-wide epigenetic modifications cells
                            utilize their DNA as a shared memory system. We formulate a particular
                            consensus problem, called the epigenetic consensus problem, that cells attempt
                            to solve using this shared memory model, and then present algorithms, derive
                            expected run time and discuss, analyze and simulate improved methods for
                            solving this problem. Analysis of real biological data indicates that the
                            computational methods indeed reflect aspects of the biological process for
                            genome-wide epigenetic modifications.

                            Nested relations, built up from atomic types via tupling and set types, form
                            a rich data model. Over the last decades the nested relational calculus, NRC,
                            has emerged as a standard language for defining transformations on nested
                            collections. NRC is a strongly-typed functional language which allows building
                            up queries using products and projections, a singleton-former, and a map
                            operation that lifts queries on tuples to queries on sets. In this work we show
                            that NRC has a strong connection with first-order logic: it contains exactly
                            the transformations that are implicitly definable by formulas $\varphi$ in
                            first-order logic with quantification suited for nested collections.
                            <br />We also prove an effective variant of our result, providing a procedure that
                            synthesizes an NRC expression in polynomial time from a proof witnessing that
                            $\varphi$ provides an implicit definition for one subset of its free variables
                            in terms of another subset of the variables. This synthesis result works off of
                            proofs within an intuitionistic calculus that captures a natural style of
                            reasoning about implicit definability in the context of nested collections.

                            We introduce a new discretization for the stream function formulation of the
                            incompressible Stokes equations in two and three space dimensions. The method
                            is strongly related to the Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson method and is based on the
                            recently discovered mass conserving mixed stress formulation [J.
                            Gopalakrishnan, P.L. Lederer, J. Sch\"oberl, IMA Journal of numerical Analysis,
                            2019] that approximates the velocity in an $H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming
                            space and introduces a new stress-like variable for the approximation of the
                            gradient of the velocity within the function space
                            $H(\operatorname{curl}\operatorname{div})$. The properties of the (discrete) de
                            Rham complex allows to extend this method to a stream function formulation in
                            two and three space dimensions.
                            <br />We present a detailed stability analysis in the continuous and the discrete
                            setting where the stream function $\psi$ and its approximation $\psi_h$ are
                            elements of $H(\operatorname{curl})$ and the
                            $H(\operatorname{curl})$-conforming N\'ed\'elec finite element space,
                            respectively. We conclude with an error analysis revealing optimal convergence
                            rates for the error of the discrete velocity $u_h =
                            \operatorname{curl}(\psi_h)$ measured in a discrete $H^1$-norm. We present
                            numerical examples to validate our findings and discuss structure-preserving
                            properties such as pressure-robustness.

                            Distribution grids across the world are undergoing profound changes due to
                            advances in energy technologies. Electrification of the transportation sector
                            and the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as
                            photo-voltaic panels and energy storage devices has gained substantial
                            momentum, especially at the edge of the grid. However, the massive
                            transformation in the technological aspects of the grid could directly conflict
                            with existing utility business models and tariff structures applied to retail
                            customers. This paper proposes a restructured business model where the
                            implementation of these grid-edge technologies is aligned with the interest of
                            all stakeholders involved in the electricity ecosystem. This envisions a shift
                            from treating electricity as a commodity where the users are charged based on
                            their volumetric consumption, to treating it as a service provided to the
                            end-user by the utility company based on the principle of cost-causation. The
                            proposed rate structure considers the impact of individual customers on the
                            distribution grid by calculating metrics that contribute directly to the costs
                            incurred by the utility companies, namely magnitude and variability of the
                            demand.

                            Appropriate allocation of system resources is essential for meeting the
                            increased user-traffic demands in the next generation wireless technologies.
                            Traditionally, the system relies on channel state information (CSI) of the
                            users for optimizing the resource allocation, which becomes costly for
                            fast-varying channel conditions. Considering that future wireless technologies
                            will be based on dense network deployment, where the mobile terminals are in
                            line-of-sight of the transmitters, the position information of terminals
                            provides an alternative to estimate the channel condition. In this work, we
                            propose a coordinates-based resource allocation scheme using supervised machine
                            learning techniques, and investigate how efficiently this scheme performs in
                            comparison to the traditional approach under various propagation conditions. We
                            consider a simplistic system set up as a first step, where a single transmitter
                            serves a single mobile user. The performance results show that the
                            coordinates-based resource allocation scheme achieves a performance very close
                            to the CSI-based scheme, even when the available coordinates of terminals are
                            erroneous. The proposed scheme performs consistently well with realistic-system
                            simulation, requiring only 4 s of training time, and the appropriate resource
                            allocation is predicted in less than 90 microseconds with a learnt model of
                            size less than 1 kB.

                            Software systems nowadays are complex and difficult to maintain due to
                            continuous changes and bad design choices. To handle the complexity of systems,
                            software products are, in general, decomposed in terms of packages/modules
                            containing classes that are dependent. However, it is challenging to
                            automatically remodularize systems to improve their maintainability. The
                            majority of existing remodularization work mainly satisfy one objective which
                            is improving the structure of packages by optimizing coupling and cohesion. In
                            addition, most of existing studies are limited to only few operation types such
                            as move class and split packages. Many other objectives, such as the design
                            semantics, reducing the number of changes and maximizing the consistency with
                            development change history, are important to improve the quality of the
                            software by remodularizing it. In this paper, we propose a novel many-objective
                            search-based approach using NSGA-III. The process aims at finding the optimal
                            remodularization solutions that improve the structure of packages, minimize the
                            number of changes, preserve semantics coherence, and re-use the history of
                            changes. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using four different
                            open-source systems and one automotive industry project, provided by our
                            industrial partner, through a quantitative and qualitative study conducted with
                            software engineers.

                            We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods among agents
                            with subadditive valuations in a fair and efficient manner. Envy-Freeness up to
                            any good (EFX) is the most compelling notion of fairness in the context of
                            indivisible goods. Although the existence of EFX is not known beyond the simple
                            case of two agents with subadditive valuations, some good approximations of EFX
                            are known to exist, namely $\tfrac{1}{2}$-EFX allocation and EFX allocations
                            with bounded charity.
                            <br />Nash welfare (the geometric mean of agents' valuations) is one of the most
                            commonly used measures of efficiency. In case of additive valuations, an
                            allocation that maximizes Nash welfare also satisfies fairness properties like
                            Envy-Free up to one good (EF1). Although there is substantial work on
                            approximating Nash welfare when agents have additive valuations, very little is
                            known when agents have subadditive valuations. In this paper, we design a
                            polynomial-time algorithm that outputs an allocation that satisfies either of
                            the two approximations of EFX as well as achieves an $\mathcal{O}(n)$
                            approximation to the Nash welfare. Our result also improves the current
                            best-known approximation of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(m)$ to
                            Nash welfare when agents have submodular and subadditive valuations,
                            respectively.
                            <br />Furthermore, our technique also gives an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ approximation to a
                            family of welfare measures, $p$-mean of valuations for $p\in (-\infty, 1]$,
                            thereby also matching asymptotically the current best known approximation ratio
                            for special cases like $p =-\infty$ while also retaining the fairness
                            properties.

                            We have witnessed rapid advances in both face presentation attack models and
                            presentation attack detection (PAD) in recent years. When compared with widely
                            studied 2D face presentation attacks, 3D face spoofing attacks are more
                            challenging because face recognition systems (FRS) are more easily confused by
                            the 3D characteristics of materials similar to real faces. In this work, we
                            tackle the problem of detecting these realistic 3D face presentation attacks,
                            and propose a novel anti-spoofing method from the perspective of fine-grained
                            classification. Our method, based on factorized bilinear coding of multiple
                            color channels (namely MC_FBC), targets at learning subtle visual differences
                            between real and fake images. By extracting discriminative and fusing
                            complementary information from RGB and YCbCr spaces, we have developed a
                            principled solution to 3D face spoofing detection. A large-scale wax figure
                            face database (WFFD) with both still and moving wax faces has also been
                            collected as super-realistic attacks to facilitate the study of 3D face PAD.
                            Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the
                            state-of-the-art performance on both our own WFFD and other face spoofing
                            databases under various intra-database and inter-database testing scenarios.

                            management is a key factor. Dialog systems, being able to hold a conversation
                            with humans, could support the knowledge management in business environment.
                            Although, these systems are currently hand-coded and need the intervention of a

                            environment. An initial taxonomy, containing entities expected to be found in
                            maintenance manuals, is used to identify the relevant sentences of a manual
                            provided by the company BOBST SA and applying text mining techniques, it is
                            automatically expanded. The final result is a taxonomy network representing the
                            entities and their relation, that will be used in future works for managing the
                            interactions of a maintenance chatbot.

                            The research presented here has been conducted as part of professor Fabrizion
                            Granelli's course "Advanced Network Modeling and Design" at UniTn and regards
                            the use of drones as mobile base stations. With the advent of fifth generation
                            (5G) RANs, networks will have to handle an increasing amount of diverse
                            devices. This will lead to a greater demand on current telecom companies and
                            infrastructures. Solutions to meet these current new demands might not suffice
                            in guaranteeing the required service for the increasing demand. In emergency
                            situations in particular, using terrestrial infrastructures is impossible for
                            various reasons. All these factors suggest exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles
                            as mobile base stations, overcoming all these adversities. The current state of
                            the art is evaluated, in order to pinpoint the best approach which fulfills all
                            requirements; in doing so, the business impact is also taken into account. This
                            proposal is a guideline for further research and the eventual creation of a new
                            startup. The outline of the research proposal is as follows: 1) This section is
                            a brief overview of the current state of the art, examining what is readily
                            available and what needs to be further developed. 2) This section covers the
                            research proposal, an appropriate solution is suggested, overcoming the
                            shortcomings of the current state of the art. 3) This section covers the
                            possible business impacts and outcomes that this research could have if further
                            developed and implemented.

                            Time is deeply woven into how people perceive, and communicate about the
                            world. Almost unconsciously, we provide our language utterances with temporal
                            cues, like verb tenses, and we can hardly produce sentences without such cues.
                            Extracting temporal cues from text, and constructing a global temporal view
                            about the order of described events is a major challenge of automatic natural
                            language understanding. Temporal reasoning, the process of combining different
                            temporal cues into a coherent temporal view, plays a central role in temporal
                            information extraction. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the
                            research from the past decades on temporal reasoning for automatic temporal
                            information extraction from text, providing a case study on the integration of
                            symbolic reasoning with machine learning-based information extraction systems.

                            The current deep learning based visual tracking approaches have been very
                            successful by learning the target classification and/or estimation model from a
                            large amount of supervised training data in offline mode. However, most of them
                            can still fail in tracking objects due to some more challenging issues such as
                            dense distractor objects, confusing background, motion blurs, and so on.
                            Inspired by the human "visual tracking" capability which leverages motion cues
                            to distinguish the target from the background, we propose a Two-Stream Residual
                            Convolutional Network (TS-RCN) for visual tracking, which successfully exploits
                            both appearance and motion features for model update. Our TS-RCN can be
                            integrated with existing deep learning based visual trackers. To further
                            improve the tracking performance, we adopt a "wider" residual network ResNeXt
                            as its feature extraction backbone. To the best of our knowledge, TS-RCN is the
                            first end-to-end trainable two-stream visual tracking system, which makes full
                            use of both appearance and motion features of the target. We have extensively
                            evaluated the TS-RCN on most widely used benchmark datasets including VOT2018,
                            VOT2019, and GOT-10K. The experiment results have successfully demonstrated
                            that our two-stream model can greatly outperform the appearance based tracker,
                            and it also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The tracking system can run
                            at up to 38.1 FPS.

                            Multi-head attentive neural architectures have achieved state-of-the-art
                            results on a variety of natural language processing tasks. Evidence has shown
                            that they are overparameterized; attention heads can be pruned without
                            significant performance loss. In this work, we instead "reallocate" them -- the
                            model learns to activate different heads on different inputs. Drawing
                            connections between multi-head attention and mixture of experts, we propose the
                            mixture of attentive experts model (MAE). MAE is trained using a block
                            coordinate descent algorithm that alternates between updating (1) the
                            responsibilities of the experts and (2) their parameters. Experiments on
                            machine translation and language modeling show that MAE outperforms strong
                            baselines on both tasks. Particularly, on the WMT14 English to German
                            translation dataset, MAE improves over "transformer-base" by 0.8 BLEU, with a
                            comparable number of parameters. Our analysis shows that our model learns to
                            specialize different experts to different inputs.

                            Political science, and social science in general, have traditionally been
                            using computational methods to study areas such as voting behavior, policy
                            making, international conflict, and international development. More recently,
                            increasingly available quantities of data are being combined with improved
                            algorithms and affordable computational resources to predict, learn, and
                            discover new insights from data that is large in volume and variety. New
                            developments in the areas of machine learning, deep learning, natural language
                            processing (NLP), and, more generally, artificial intelligence (AI) are opening
                            up new opportunities for testing theories and evaluating the impact of
                            interventions and programs in a more dynamic and effective way. Applications
                            using large volumes of structured and unstructured data are becoming common in
                            government and industry, and increasingly also in social science research. This
                            chapter offers an introduction to such methods drawing examples from political
                            science. Focusing on the areas where the strengths of the methods coincide with
                            challenges in these fields, the chapter first presents an introduction to AI
                            and its core technology - machine learning, with its rapidly developing
                            subfield of deep learning. The discussion of deep neural networks is
                            illustrated with the NLP tasks that are relevant to political science. The
                            latest advances in deep learning methods for NLP are also reviewed, together
                            with their potential for improving information extraction and pattern
                            recognition from political science texts.

                            Human behavior drives a range of complex social, urban, and economic systems,
                            yet understanding its structure and dynamics at the individual level remains an
                            open question. From credit card transactions to communications data, human
                            behavior appears to exhibit bursts of activity driven by task prioritization
                            and periodicity, however, current research does not offer generative models
                            capturing these mechanisms. We propose a multivariate, periodic Hawkes process
                            (MPHP) model that captures -- at the individual level -- the temporal
                            clustering of human activity, the interdependence structure and co-excitation
                            of different activities, and the periodic effects of weekly rhythms. We also
                            propose a scalable parameter estimation technique for this model using
                            maximum-aposteriori expectation-maximization that additionally provides
                            estimation of latent variables revealing branching structure of an individual's
                            behavior patterns. We apply the model to a large dataset of credit card
                            transactions, and demonstrate the MPHP outperforms a non-homogeneous Poisson
                            model and LDA in both statistical fit for the distribution of inter-event times
                            and an activity prediction task.

                            The Digital Corpus of Sanskrit records around 650,000 sentences along with
                            their morphological and lexical tagging. But inconsistencies in morphological
                            analysis, and in providing crucial information like the segmented word, urges
                            the need for standardization and validation of this corpus. Automating the
                            validation process requires efficient analyzers which also provide the missing
                            information. The Sanskrit Heritage Engine's Reader produces all possible
                            segmentations with morphological and lexical analyses. Aligning these systems
                            would help us in recording the linguistic differences, which can be used to
                            update these systems to produce standardized results and will also provide a
                            Gold corpus tagged with complete morphological and lexical information along
                            with the segmented words. Krishna et al. (2017) aligned 115,000 sentences,
                            considering some of the linguistic differences. As both these systems have
                            evolved significantly, the alignment is done again considering all the
                            remaining linguistic differences between these systems. This paper describes
                            the modified alignment process in detail and records the additional linguistic
                            differences observed.

                            The COVID-19 is sweeping the world with deadly consequences. Its contagious
                            nature and clinical similarity to other pneumonias make separating subjects
                            contracted with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia a priority and a
                            challenge. However, COVID-19 testing has been greatly limited by the
                            availability and cost of existing methods, even in developed countries like the
                            US. Intrigued by the wide availability of routine blood tests, we propose to
                            leverage them for COVID-19 testing using the power of machine learning. Two
                            proven-robust machine learning model families, random forests (RFs) and support
                            vector machines (SVMs), are employed to tackle the challenge. Trained on blood
                            data from 208 moderate COVID-19 subjects and 86 subjects with non-COVID-19
                            moderate viral pneumonia, the best result is obtained in an SVM-based
                            classifier with an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 80%,
                            and a precision of 92%. The results are found explainable from both machine
                            learning and medical perspectives. A privacy-protected web portal is set up to
                            help medical personnel in their practice and the trained models are released
                            for developers to further build other applications. We hope our results can
                            help the world fight this pandemic and welcome clinical verification of our
                            approach on larger populations.

                            Meta-materials are an important emerging class of engineered materials in
                            which complex macroscopic behaviour--whether electromagnetic, thermal, or
                            mechanical--arises from modular substructure. Simulation and optimization of
                            these materials are computationally challenging, as rich substructures
                            necessitate high-fidelity finite element meshes to solve the governing PDEs. To
                            address this, we leverage parametric modular structure to learn component-level
                            surrogates, enabling cheaper high-fidelity simulation. We use a neural network
                            to model the stored potential energy in a component given boundary conditions.
                            This yields a structured prediction task: macroscopic behavior is determined by
                            the minimizer of the system's total potential energy, which can be approximated
                            by composing these surrogate models. Composable energy surrogates thus permit
                            simulation in the reduced basis of component boundaries. Costly ground-truth
                            simulation of the full structure is avoided, as training data are generated by
                            performing finite element analysis with individual components. Using dataset
                            aggregation to choose training boundary conditions allows us to learn energy
                            surrogates which produce accurate macroscopic behavior when composed,
                            accelerating simulation of parametric meta-materials.

                            We present QADI, an automatically collected dataset of tweets belonging to a
                            wide range of country-level Arabic dialects -covering 18 different countries in
                            the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. Our method for building this
                            dataset relies on applying multiple filters to identify users who belong to
                            different countries based on their account descriptions and to eliminate tweets
                            that are either written in Modern Standard Arabic or contain inappropriate
                            language. The resultant dataset contains 540k tweets from 2,525 users who are
                            evenly distributed across 18 Arab countries. Using intrinsic evaluation, we
                            show that the labels of a set of randomly selected tweets are 91.5% accurate.
                            For extrinsic evaluation, we are able to build effective country-level dialect

                            The role of social media in promoting media pluralism was initially viewed as
                            wholly positive. However, some governments are allegedly manipulating social
                            media by hiring online commentators (also known as trolls) to spread propaganda
                            and disinformation. In particular, an alleged system of professional trolls
                            operating both domestically and internationally exists in Russia. In 2018,
                            Twitter released data on accounts identified as Russian trolls, starting a wave
                            of research. However, while foreign-targeted English language operations of
                            these trolls have received significant attention, no research has analyzed
                            their Russian language domestic and regional-targeted activities. We address
                            this gap by characterizing the Russian-language operations of Russian trolls.
                            We first perform a descriptive analysis, and then focus in on the trolls'
                            operation related to the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.
                            <br />Among other things, we find that Russian-language trolls have run 163 hashtag
                            campaigns (where hashtag use grows abruptly within a month). The main political
                            sentiments of such campaigns were praising Russia and Putin (29%), criticizing
                            Ukraine (26%), and criticizing the United States and Obama (9%). Further,
                            trolls actively reshared information with 76% of tweets being retweets or
                            containing a URL. Additionally, we observe periodic temporal patterns of
                            tweeting suggesting that trolls use automation tools. Further, we find that
                            trolls' information campaign on the MH17 crash was the largest in terms of
                            tweet count. However, around 68% of tweets posted with MH17 hashtags were
                            likely used simply for hashtag amplification. With these tweets excluded, about
                            49% of the tweets suggested to varying levels that Ukraine was responsible for
                            the crash, and only 13% contained disinformation and propaganda presented as
                            news. Interestingly, trolls promoted inconsistent alternative theories for the
                            crash.

                            We introduce a dynamical low-rank method to reduce the computational
                            complexity for solving the multi-scale multi-dimensional linear transport
                            equation. The method is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the equation.
                            The proposed numerical method uses the low rank approximation only for the
                            micro part of the solution. The time and spatial discretizations are done
                            properly so that the overall scheme is second order accurate and
                            asymptotic-preserving (AP); that is, in the diffusive regime, the scheme
                            becomes a macroscopic solver for the limiting diffusion equation and is
                            automatically low rank. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the
                            proposed low rank method by a number of two-dimensional examples.

                            Few works in the literature of event extraction have gone beyond individual
                            sentences to make extraction decisions. This is problematic when the
                            information needed to recognize an event argument is spread across multiple
                            sentences. We argue that document-level event extraction is a difficult task
                            since it requires a view of a larger context to determine which spans of text
                            correspond to event role fillers. We first investigate how end-to-end neural
                            sequence models (with pre-trained language model representations) perform on
                            document-level role filler extraction, as well as how the length of context
                            captured affects the models' performance. To dynamically aggregate information
                            captured by neural representations learned at different levels of granularity
                            (e.g., the sentence- and paragraph-level), we propose a novel multi-granularity
                            reader. We evaluate our models on the MUC-4 event extraction dataset, and show
                            that our best system performs substantially better than prior work. We also
                            report findings on the relationship between context length and neural model
                            performance on the task.

                            Given that a MAC address can uniquely identify a person or a vehicle,
                            continuous tracking over a large geographical scale has raised serious privacy
                            concerns amongst governments and the general public. Prior work has
                            demonstrated that simple hash-based approaches to anonymization can be easily
                            inverted due to the small search space of MAC addresses. In particular, it is
                            possible to represent the entire allocated MAC address space in 39 bits and
                            that frequency-based attacks allow for 50% of MAC addresses to be enumerated in
                            31 bits. We present a practical approach to MAC address anonymization using
                            both computationally expensive hash functions and truncating the resulting
                            hashes to allow for k-anonymity. We provide an expression for computing the
                            percentage of expected collisions, demonstrating that for digests of 24 bits it
                            is possible to store up to 168,617 MAC addresses with the rate of collisions
                            less than 1%. We experimentally demonstrate that a rate of collision of 1% or
                            less can be achieved by storing data sets of 100 MAC addresses in 13 bits,
                            1,000 MAC addresses in 17 bits and 10,000 MAC addresses in 20 bits.

                            One of the major challenges for autonomous vehicles in urban environments is
                            to understand and predict other road users' actions, in particular, pedestrians
                            at the point of crossing. The common approach to solving this problem is to use
                            the motion history of the agents to predict their future trajectories. However,
                            pedestrians exhibit highly variable actions most of which cannot be understood
                            without visual observation of the pedestrians themselves and their
                            surroundings. To this end, we propose a solution for the problem of pedestrian
                            action anticipation at the point of crossing. Our approach uses a novel stacked
                            RNN architecture in which information collected from various sources, both
                            scene dynamics and visual features, is gradually fused into the network at
                            different levels of processing. We show, via extensive empirical evaluations,
                            that the proposed algorithm achieves a higher prediction accuracy compared to
                            alternative recurrent network architectures. We conduct experiments to
                            investigate the impact of the length of observation, time to event and types of
                            features on the performance of the proposed method. Finally, we demonstrate how
                            different data fusion strategies impact prediction accuracy.

                            Recent advances in the field of saliency have concentrated on fixation
                            prediction, with benchmarks reaching saturation. However, there is an extensive
                            body of works in psychology and neuroscience that describe aspects of human
                            visual attention that might not be adequately captured by current approaches.
                            Here, we investigate singleton detection, which can be thought of as a
                            canonical example of salience. We introduce two novel datasets, one with
                            psychophysical patterns and one with natural odd-one-out stimuli. Using these
                            datasets we demonstrate through extensive experimentation that nearly all
                            saliency algorithms do not adequately respond to singleton targets in synthetic
                            and natural images. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of training
                            state-of-the-art CNN-based saliency models on these types of stimuli and
                            conclude that the additional training data does not lead to a significant
                            improvement of their ability to find odd-one-out targets.

                            Fashion is an inherently visual concept and computer vision and artificial
                            intelligence (AI) are playing an increasingly important role in shaping the
                            future of this domain. Many research has been done on recommending fashion
                            products based on the learned user preferences. However, in addition to
                            recommending single items, AI can also help users create stylish outfits from
                            items they already have, or purchase additional items that go well with their
                            current wardrobe. Compatibility is the key factor in creating stylish outfits
                            from single items. Previous studies have mostly focused on modeling pair-wise
                            compatibility. There are a few approaches that consider an entire outfit, but
                            these approaches have limitations such as requiring rich semantic information,
                            category labels, and fixed order of items. Thus, they fail to effectively
                            determine compatibility when such information is not available. In this work,
                            we adopt a Relation Network (RN) to develop new compatibility learning models,
                            Fashion RN and FashionRN-VSE, that addresses the limitations of existing
                            approaches. FashionRN learns the compatibility of an entire outfit, with an
                            arbitrary number of items, in an arbitrary order. We evaluated our model using
                            a large dataset of 49,740 outfits that we collected from Polyvore website.
                            Quantitatively, our experimental results demonstrate state of the art
                            performance compared with alternative methods in the literature in both
                            compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank test. Qualitatively, we also
                            show that the item embedding learned by FashionRN indicate the compatibility
                            among fashion items.

                            Protecting embedded security is becoming an increasingly challenging research
                            problem for embedded systems due to a number of emerging trends in hardware,
                            software, networks, and applications. Without fundamental advances in, and an
                            understanding of embedded security it will be difficult for future engineers to
                            provide assurance for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology
                            (OT) in wide ranging applications, from home automation and autonomous
                            transportation to medical devices and factory floors. Common to such
                            applications are cyberphysical risks and consequences stemming from a lack of
                            embedded security. The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a one-day
                            visioning workshop to explore these issues. The workshop focused on five major
                            application areas of embedded systems, namely (1) medical/wearable devices, (2)
                            autonomous systems (drones, vehicles, robots), (3) smart homes, (4) industry
                            and supply chain, and (5) critical infrastructure. This report synthesizes the
                            results of that workshop and develops a list of strategic goals for research
                            and education over the next 5-10 years.
                            <br />Embedded security in connected devices presents challenges that require a
                            broad look at the overall systems design, including human and societal
                            dimensions as well as technical. Particular issues related to embedded security
                            are a subset of the overall security of the application areas, which must also
                            balance other design criteria such as cost, power, reliability, usability and
                            function. Recent trends are converging to make the security of embedded systems
                            an increasingly important and difficult objective, requiring new
                            trans-disciplinary approaches to solve problems on a 5-10 year horizon.

                            of answer span detection. The predicted logical forms also serve as a rationale

                            Relation extraction is the task of extracting semantic relations between
                            entities in a sentence. It is an essential part of some natural language
                            processing tasks such as information extraction, knowledge extraction, and
                            knowledge base population. The main motivations of this research stem from a
                            lack of a dataset for relation extraction in the Persian language as well as
                            the necessity of extracting knowledge from the growing big-data in the Persian
                            language for different applications. In this paper, we present "PERLEX" as the
                            first Persian dataset for relation extraction, which is an expert-translated
                            version of the "Semeval-2010-Task-8" dataset. Moreover, this paper addresses
                            Persian relation extraction utilizing state-of-the-art language-agnostic
                            algorithms. We employ six different models for relation extraction on the
                            proposed bilingual dataset, including a non-neural model (as the baseline),
                            three neural models, and two deep learning models fed by multilingual-BERT
                            contextual word representations. The experiments result in the maximum f-score
                            77.66% (provided by BERTEM-MTB method) as the state-of-the-art of relation
                            extraction in the Persian language.

                            Information and communications technologies have enabled the rise of the
                            phenomenon named sharing economy, which represents activities between people,
                            coordinated by online platforms, to obtain, provide, or share access to goods
                            and services. In hosting services of the sharing economy, it is common to have
                            a personal contact between the host and guest, and this may affect users'
                            decision to do negative reviews, as negative reviews can damage the offered
                            services. To evaluate this issue, we collected reviews from two sharing economy
                            platforms, Airbnb and Couchsurfing, and from one platform that works mostly
                            with hotels (traditional economy), Booking.com, for some cities in Brazil and
                            the USA. Trough a sentiment analysis, we found that reviews in the sharing
                            economy tend to be considerably more positive than those in the traditional
                            economy. This can represent a problem in those systems, as an experiment with
                            volunteers performed in this study suggests. In addition, we discuss how to
                            exploit the results obtained to help improve users' decision making.

                            This paper introduces Action Image, a new grasp proposal representation that
                            allows learning an end-to-end deep-grasping policy. Our model achieves $84\%$
                            grasp success on $172$ real world objects while being trained only in
                            simulation on $48$ objects with just naive domain randomization. Similar to
                            computer vision problems, such as object detection, Action Image builds on the
                            idea that object features are invariant to translation in image space.
                            Therefore, grasp quality is invariant when evaluating the object-gripper
                            relationship; a successful grasp for an object depends on its local context,
                            but is independent of the surrounding environment. Action Image represents a
                            grasp proposal as an image and uses a deep convolutional network to infer grasp
                            quality. We show that by using an Action Image representation, trained networks
                            are able to extract local, salient features of grasping tasks that generalize
                            across different objects and environments. We show that this representation
                            works on a variety of inputs, including color images (RGB), depth images (D),
                            and combined color-depth (RGB-D). Our experimental results demonstrate that
                            networks utilizing an Action Image representation exhibit strong domain
                            transfer between training on simulated data and inference on real-world sensor
                            streams. Finally, our experiments show that a network trained with Action Image
                            improves grasp success ($84\%$ vs. $53\%$) over a baseline model with the same
                            structure, but using actions encoded as vectors.

                            IoT applications are promising for future daily activities; therefore, the
                            number of IoT connected devices is expected to reach billions in the coming few
                            years. However, IoT has different application frameworks. Furthermore, IoT
                            applications require higher security standards. In this work, an IoT
                            application framework is presented with a security embedded structure using the
                            integration between message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) and user managed
                            access (UMA). The performance analysis of the model is presented. Comparing the
                            model with existing models and different design structures shows that the model
                            presented in this work is promising for a functioning IoT design model with
                            security. The security in the model is a built-in feature in its structure. The
                            model is built on recommended frameworks; therefore, it is ready for
                            integration with other web standards for data sharing, which will help in
                            making IoT application integrated from different developing parties.

                            organizing the collected data at a central location. These Sensor nodes are
                            powered by a battery, so energy conservation becomes an important aspect in
                            WSN. The Paper proposes a way of combining traditional LEACH (Low Energy
                            Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) with Mobile Sink and Rendezvous Nodes (RN Nodes)
                            along with some changes in terms of cluster head selection process. The paper
                            aims at decreasing the number of dead nodes which in turn will relate to a
                            increase in the total network lifetime. Particularly for large regions the
                            proposed algorithms outperforms traditional Leach as proved in the Simulation
                            Results.

                            This paper introduces Carnegie Mellon campus-wide CarnegiePLUG test-bed. This
                            test-bed in a hardware-in-the-loop simulator that enables large-scale sensing,
                            computation and actuation over a network of heterogeneous energy producers and
                            consumers (prosuming) assets. CarnegiePLUG is a multi-agent framework that
                            facilitates plug-and-play integration of a wide range of virtual and physical
                            sensors and controllers through a multi-layer architecture. Virtual
                            functionalities are accessed in software environments that interface with
                            communication layer of our test-bed. This paper discusses CarnegiePLUG layers,
                            provides implementation details and showcases potential applications of this

                            Wireless Sensor Network WSN is consisted of nodes with different sizes and a
                            specific goal. Tracking applications are very important in WSNs. This study
                            proposes a method for reducing energy consumption in WSNs, considering target
                            tracking. A prediction method is also presented with the help of MAC Medium
                            Access Control layer in which a few number of nodes are in active mode to track
                            the target while the rest of the nodes are switched into sleeping mode. Energy
                            consumption was reduced by decreasing the number of nodes involved in target
                            tracking and activating merely a limited number of necessary nodes. The
                            conducted experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm has a much better
                            performance compared to similar algorithms in different conditions, including
                            energy consumption in different communication ranges, effect of the number of
                            nodes on energy consumption, the number of nodes involved in tracking in terms
                            of communication range, and losing the target. This means the proposed method
                            is superior and more efficient. When the target enters the simulation area,
                            nodes of the network identify the target node through the proposed method
                            (which is the optimum method) and track it as long as it is inside the
                            simulation area. Performance criteria, including energy, other nodes, and
                            throughput were used in simulation. The results showed that the proposed method
                            has the optimum performance and reduces energy consumption of the network
                            during tracking. The results of the simulation showed that the proposed method
                            reduces energy consumption to an acceptable extent, compared to previous
                            methods, in addition to increasing the accuracy of target tracking. Keywords:

                            Phishing is considered to be one of the most prevalent cyber-attacks because
                            of its immense flexibility and alarmingly high success rate. Even with adequate
                            training and high situational awareness, it can still be hard for users to
                            continually be aware of the URL of the website they are visiting. Traditional
                            detection methods rely on blocklists and content analysis, both of which
                            require time-consuming human verification. Thus, there have been attempts
                            focusing on the predictive filtering of such URLs. This study aims to develop a
                            machine-learning model to detect fraudulent URLs which can be used within the
                            Splunk platform. Inspired from similar approaches in the literature, we trained
                            the SVM and Random Forests algorithms using malicious and benign datasets found
                            in the literature and one dataset that we created. We evaluated the algorithms'
                            performance with precision and recall, reaching up to 85% precision and 87%
                            recall in the case of Random Forests while SVM achieved up to 90% precision and
                            88% recall using only descriptive features.

                            Grammar error correction (GEC) is an important application aspect of natural
                            language processing techniques. The past decade has witnessed significant
                            progress achieved in GEC for the sake of increasing popularity of machine
                            learning and deep learning, especially in late 2010s when near human-level GEC
                            systems are available. However, there is no prior work focusing on the whole
                            recapitulation of the progress. We present the first survey in GEC for a
                            comprehensive retrospect of the literature in this area. We first give the
                            introduction of five public datasets, data annotation schema, two important
                            shared tasks and four standard evaluation metrics. More importantly, we discuss
                            four kinds of basic approaches, including statistical machine translation based
                            approach, neural machine translation based approach, classification based
                            approach and language model based approach, six commonly applied performance
                            boosting techniques for GEC systems and two data augmentation methods. Since
                            GEC is typically viewed as a sister task of machine translation, many GEC
                            systems are based on neural machine translation (NMT) approaches, where the
                            neural sequence-to-sequence model is applied. Similarly, some performance
                            boosting techniques are adapted from machine translation and are successfully
                            combined with GEC systems for enhancement on the final performance.
                            Furthermore, we conduct an analysis in level of basic approaches, performance
                            boosting techniques and integrated GEC systems based on their experiment
                            results respectively for more clear patterns and conclusions. Finally, we
                            discuss five prospective directions for future GEC researches.

                            The PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) is
                            usually used to formulate evidence in the medical domain. The major task of
                            PICO extraction is to extract sentences from medical literature and classify
                            them into each class. However, in most circumstances, there will be more than
                            one evidences in an extracted sentence even it has been categorized to a
                            certain class. In order to address this problem, we propose a step-wise disease
                            Named Entity Recognition (DNER) extraction and PICO identification method. With
                            our method, sentences in paper title and abstract are first classified into
                            different classes of PICO, and medical entities are then identified and
                            classified into P and O. Different kinds of deep learning frameworks are used
                            and experimental results show that our method will achieve high performance and
                            fine-grained extraction results comparing with conventional PICO extraction
                            works.

                            that (1) context-free word representations are a powerful and robust baseline,
                            (2) a sentence classification objective can be used to obtain useful
                            context-dependent word representations, and (3) combining context-free and
                            context-dependent representations often improves performance, suggesting that

                            Introduction: Increasingly, the label data trust is being applied to
                            repeatable mechanisms or approaches to sharing data in a timely, fair, safe and
                            equitable way. However, there is a gap in terms of practical guidance about how
                            to establish and operate a data trust.
                            <br />Aim and Approach: In December 2019, the Canadian Institute for Health
                            Information and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence convened a
                            working meeting of 19 people representing 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives
                            involved in data sharing, most of which focus on public sector health data. The
                            objective was to identify essential requirements for the establishment and
                            operation of data trusts. Preliminary findings were presented during the
                            meeting then refined as participants and co-authors identified relevant
                            literature and contributed to this manuscript.
                            <br />Results: Twelve (12) minimum specification requirements (min specs) for data
                            trusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts must meet
                            all legal requirements, including legal authority to collect, hold or share
                            data. In addition, there was agreement that data trusts must have (i) an
                            accountable governing body which ensures the data trust advances its stated
                            purpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive data management including
                            responsible parties and clear processes for the collection, storage, access,
                            disclosure and use of data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for
                            all data users and (iv) ongoing public and stakeholder engagement.
                            <br />Conclusion / Implications: Based on a review of the literature and advice
                            from participants from 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives, practical
                            guidance in the form of twelve min specs for data trusts were agreed on. Public
                            engagement and continued exchange of insights and experience is recommended on
                            this evolving topic.

                            Authorship verification (AV) is an important sub-area of digital text
                            forensics and has been researched for more than two decades. The fundamental
                            question addressed by AV is whether two documents were written by the same
                            person. A serious problem that has received little attention in the literature
                            so far is the question if AV methods actually focus on the writing style during
                            classification, or whether they are unintentionally distorted by the topic of
                            the documents. To counteract this problem, we propose an effective technique
                            called POSNoise, which aims to mask topic-related content in documents. In this
                            way, AV methods are forced to focus on those text units that are more related
                            to the author's writing style. Based on a comprehensive evaluation with eight
                            existing AV methods applied to eight corpora, we demonstrate that POSNoise is
                            able to outperform a well-known topic masking approach in 51 out of 64 cases
                            with up to 12.5% improvement in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we show that
                            for corpora preprocessed with POSNoise, the AV methods examined often achieve
                            higher accuracies (improvement of up to 20.6%) compared to the original
                            corpora.

                            This paper introduces Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE), a new segmentation
                            algorithm for tokenizing sentences into subword units. We view the subword
                            segmentation of output sentences as a latent variable that should be
                            marginalized out for learning and inference. A mixed character-subword
                            transformer is proposed, which enables exact log marginal likelihood estimation
                            and exact MAP inference to find target segmentations with maximum posterior
                            probability. DPE uses a lightweight mixed character-subword transformer as a
                            means of pre-processing parallel data to segment output sentences using dynamic
                            programming. Empirical results on machine translation suggest that DPE is
                            effective for segmenting output sentences and can be combined with BPE dropout
                            for stochastic segmentation of source sentences. DPE achieves an average
                            improvement of 0.9 BLEU over BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and an average
                            improvement of 0.55 BLEU over BPE dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) on several
                            WMT datasets including English &lt;=&gt; (German, Romanian, Estonian, Finnish,
                            Hungarian).

                            Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a popular research area in NLP has
                            two distinct parts -- aspect extraction (AE) and labeling the aspects with
                            sentiment polarity (ALSA). Although distinct, these two tasks are highly
                            correlated. The work primarily hypothesize that transferring knowledge from a
                            pre-trained AE model can benefit the performance of ALSA models. Based on this
                            hypothesis, word embeddings are obtained during AE and subsequently, feed that
                            to the ALSA model. Empirically, this work show that the added information
                            significantly improves the performance of three different baseline ALSA models
                            on two distinct domains. This improvement also translates well across domains

                            Social media communication has become a significant part of daily activity in
                            modern societies. For this reason, ensuring safety in social media platforms is
                            a necessity. Use of dangerous language such as physical threats in online
                            environments is a somewhat rare, yet remains highly important. Although several
                            works have been performed on the related issue of detecting offensive and
                            hateful language, dangerous speech has not previously been treated in any
                            significant way. Motivated by these observations, we report our efforts to
                            build a labeled dataset for dangerous speech. We also exploit our dataset to
                            develop highly effective models to detect dangerous content. Our best model
                            performs at 59.60% macro F1, significantly outperforming a competitive
                            baseline.

                            Recent advances in neural machine translation (NMT) have led to
                            state-of-the-art results for many European-based translation tasks. However,
                            despite these advances, there is has been little focus in applying these
                            methods to African languages. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
                            creating an NMT benchmark BLEU score between English and the ten remaining
                            official languages in South Africa.

                            In the last years, cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular. Even people who
                            are not experts have started to invest in these securities and nowadays
                            cryptocurrency exchanges process transactions for over 100 billion US dollars
                            per month. However, many cryptocurrencies have low liquidity and therefore they
                            are highly prone to market manipulation schemes. In this paper, we perform an
                            in-depth analysis of pump and dump schemes organized by communities over the
                            Internet. We observe how these communities are organized and how they carry out
                            the fraud. Then, we report on two case studies related to pump and dump groups.
                            Lastly, we introduce an approach to detect the fraud in real time that
                            outperforms the current state of the art, so to help investors stay out of the
                            market when a pump and dump scheme is in action.

                            Citations play a vital role in understanding the impact of scientific
                            literature. Generally, citations are analyzed quantitatively whereas
                            qualitative analysis of citations can reveal deeper insights into the impact of
                            a scientific artifact in the community. Therefore, citation impact analysis
                            (which includes sentiment and intent classification) enables us to quantify the
                            quality of the citations which can eventually assist us in the estimation of
                            ranking and impact. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we
                            benchmark the well-known language models like BERT and ALBERT along with
                            several popular networks for both tasks of sentiment and intent classification.
                            Second, we provide ImpactCite, which is XLNet-based method for citation impact
                            analysis. All evaluations are performed on a set of publicly available citation
                            analysis datasets. Evaluation results reveal that ImpactCite achieves a new
                            state-of-the-art performance for both citation intent and sentiment
                            classification by outperforming the existing approaches by 3.44% and 1.33% in
                            F1-score. Therefore, we emphasize ImpactCite (XLNet-based solution) for both
                            tasks to better understand the impact of a citation. Additional efforts have
                            been performed to come up with CSC-Clean corpus, which is a clean and reliable
                            dataset for citation sentiment classification.

                            Since COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019, various public health
                            interventions have been implemented across the world. As different measures are
                            implemented at different countries at different times, we conduct an assessment
                            of the relative effectiveness of the measures implemented in 18 countries and
                            regions using data from 22/01/2020 to 02/04/2020. We compute the top one and
                            two measures that are most effective for the countries and regions studied
                            during the period. Two Explainable AI techniques, SHAP and ECPI, are used in
                            our study; such that we construct (machine learning) models for predicting the
                            instantaneous reproduction number ($R_t$) and use the models as surrogates to
                            the real world and inputs that the greatest influence to our models are seen as
                            measures that are most effective. Across-the-board, city lockdown and contact
                            tracing are the two most effective measures. For ensuring $R_t&lt;1$, public
                            wearing face masks is also important. Mass testing alone is not the most
                            effective measure although when paired with other measures, it can be
                            effective. Warm temperature helps for reducing the transmission.

                            The heterogeneous microstructure in metallic components results in locally
                            varying fatigue strength. Metal fatigue strongly depends on size and shape of
                            non-metallic inclusions and pores, commonly referred to as "defects". Nodular
                            cast iron (NCI) contains graphite inclusions (nodules) whose shape and
                            frequency influence the fatigue strength. Fatigue strength can be simulated by
                            micromechanical finite element models. The drawback of these models are the
                            large computational costs. Therefore, we employ a data-driven machine learning
                            methodology. More precisely, we utilize the simplified residual neural network
                            (SimResNet) which was recently introduced (Herty et al., Kinetic Theory for
                            Residual Neural Networks, 2020) to predict fatigue strength from metallographic
                            data. For the training, we use fatigue data which is simulated with a
                            micromechanical model and the shakedown theorem. The micromechanical models are
                            derived directly from micrographs of nodular cast iron, respectively. The
                            application of SimResNet shows a good performance to predict fatigue strength
                            by local microstructures of nodular cast iron. We show several test cases. The
                            simplified character of SimResNet enables fast predictions of fatigue by
                            microstructures, even in comparision to classical residual neural networks.

                            We present Korbit, a large-scale, open-domain, mixed-interface,
                            dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Korbit uses machine learning,
                            natural language processing and reinforcement learning to provide interactive,
                            personalized learning online. Korbit has been designed to easily scale to
                            thousands of subjects, by automating, standardizing and simplifying the content
                            creation process. Unlike other ITS, a teacher can develop new learning modules
                            for Korbit in a matter of hours. To facilitate learning across a widerange of
                            STEM subjects, Korbit uses a mixed-interface, which includes videos,
                            interactive dialogue-based exercises, question-answering, conceptual diagrams,
                            mathematical exercises and gamification elements. Korbit has been built to
                            scale to millions of students, by utilizing a state-of-the-art cloud-based
                            micro-service architecture. Korbit launched its first course in 2019 on machine
                            learning, and since then over 7,000 students have enrolled. Although Korbit was
                            designed to be open-domain and highly scalable, A/B testing experiments with
                            real-world students demonstrate that both student learning outcomes and student
                            motivation are substantially improved compared to typical online courses.

                            Human society had a long history of suffering from cognitive biases leading
                            to social prejudices and mass injustice. The prevalent existence of cognitive
                            biases in large volumes of historical data can pose a threat of being
                            manifested as unethical and seemingly inhuman predictions as outputs of AI
                            systems trained on such data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
                            bias-aware multi-objective learning framework that given a set of identity
                            attributes (e.g. gender, ethnicity etc.) and a subset of sensitive categories
                            of the possible classes of prediction outputs, learns to reduce the frequency
                            of predicting certain combinations of them, e.g. predicting stereotypes such as
                            `most blacks use abusive language', or `fear is a virtue of women'. Our
                            experiments conducted on an emotion prediction task with balanced class priors
                            shows that a set of baseline bias-agnostic models exhibit cognitive biases with
                            respect to gender, such as women are prone to be afraid whereas men are more
                            prone to be angry. In contrast, our proposed bias-aware multi-objective
                            learning methodology is shown to reduce such biases in the predictied emotions.

                            India locked down 1.3 billion people on March 25, 2020 in the wake of
                            COVID-19 pandemic. The economic cost of it was estimated at USD 98 billion,
                            while the social costs are still unknown. This study investigated how
                            government formed reactive policies to fight coronavirus across its policy
                            sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in
                            the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives
                            and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents
                            from the PIB. An unsupervised machine-based topic modelling using Latent
                            Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was performed on the text corpus. It was
                            done to extract high probability topics in the policy sectors. The
                            interpretation of the extracted topics was made through a nudge theoretic lens
                            to derive the critical policy heuristics of the government. Results showed that
                            most interventions were targeted to generate endogenous nudge by using external
                            triggers. Notably, the nudges from the Prime Minister of India was critical in
                            creating herd effect on lockdown and social distancing norms across the nation.
                            A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in
                            public spaces; Yoga and Ayurveda for immunity), transport (e.g., old trains
                            converted to isolation wards), micro, small and medium enterprises (e.g., rapid
                            production of PPE and masks), science and technology sector (e.g., diagnostic
                            kits, robots and nano-technology), home affairs (e.g., surveillance and
                            lockdown), urban (e.g. drones, GIS-tools) and education (e.g., online
                            learning). A conclusion was drawn on leveraging these heuristics are crucial

                            Artificial intelligence (AI) enabled products and services are becoming a
                            staple of everyday life. While governments and businesses are eager to enjoy
                            the benefits of AI innovations, the mixed impact of these autonomous and
                            intelligent systems on human well-being has become a pressing issue. This
                            article introduces one of the first international standards focused on the
                            social and ethical implications of AI: The Institute of Electrical and
                            Electronics Engineering (IEEE) Standard (Std) 7010-2020 Recommended Practice
                            for Assessing the Impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems on Human
                            Well-being. Incorporating well-being factors throughout the lifecycle of AI is
                            both challenging and urgent and IEEE 7010 provides key guidance for those who
                            design, deploy, and procure these technologies. We begin by articulating the
                            benefits of an approach for AI centered around well-being and the measurement
                            of well-being data. Next, we provide an overview of IEEE 7010, including its
                            key principles and how the standard relates to approaches and perspectives in
                            place in the AI community. Finally, we indicate where future efforts are
                            needed.

                            Many digital solutions mainly involving Bluetooth technology are being
                            proposed for Contact Tracing Apps (CTA) to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
                            Concerns have been raised regarding privacy, consent, uptake required in a
                            given population, and the degree to which use of CTAs can impact individual
                            behaviours. However, very few groups have taken a holistic approach and
                            presented a combined solution. None has presented their CTA in such a way as to
                            ensure that even the most suggestible member of our community does not become
                            complacent and assume that CTA operates as an invisible shield, making us and
                            our families impenetrable or immune to the disease. We propose to build on some
                            of the digital solutions already under development that, with addition of a
                            Bayesian model that predicts likelihood for infection supplemented by
                            traditional symptom and contact tracing, that can enable us to reach 90% of a
                            population. When combined with an effective communication strategy and social
                            distancing, we believe solutions like the one proposed here can have a very
                            beneficial effect on containing the spread of this pandemic.

                            The phrase "most cruel and revolting crimes" has been used to describe some
                            poor historical treatment of vulnerable impaired persons by precisely those who
                            should have had the responsibility of protecting and helping them. We believe
                            we might be poised to see history repeat itself, as increasingly human-like
                            aware robots become capable of engaging in behavior which we would consider
                            immoral in a human--either unknowingly or deliberately. In the current paper we
                            focus in particular on exploring some potential dangers affecting persons with
                            dementia (PWD), which could arise from insufficient software or external
                            factors, and describe a proposed solution involving rich causal models and
                            accountability measures: Specifically, the Consequences of Needs-driven
                            Dementia-compromised Behaviour model (C-NDB) could be adapted to be used with
                            conversation topic detection, causal networks and multi-criteria decision
                            making, alongside reports, audits, and deterrents. Our aim is that the
                            considerations raised could help inform the design of care robots intended to
                            support well-being in PWD.

                            Text classification tasks which aim at harvesting and/or organizing
                            information from electronic health records are pivotal to support clinical and
                            translational research. However these present specific challenges compared to
                            other classification tasks, notably due to the particular nature of the medical
                            lexicon and language used in clinical records. Recent advances in embedding
                            methods have shown promising results for several clinical tasks, yet there is
                            no exhaustive comparison of such approaches with other commonly used word
                            representations and classification models. In this work, we analyse the impact
                            of various word representations, text pre-processing and classification
                            algorithms on the performance of four different text classification tasks. The
                            results show that traditional approaches, when tailored to the specific
                            language and structure of the text inherent to the classification task, can
                            achieve or exceed the performance of more recent ones based on contextual
                            embeddings such as BERT.

                            Cyberbullying is a widespread adverse phenomenon among online social
                            interactions in today's digital society. While numerous computational studies
                            focus on enhancing the cyberbullying detection performance of machine learning
                            algorithms, proposed models tend to carry and reinforce unintended social
                            biases. In this study, we try to answer the research question of "Can we

                            model training with fairness constraints?". For this purpose, we propose a
                            model training scheme that can employ fairness constraints and validate our
                            approach with different datasets. We demonstrate that various types of
                            unintended biases can be successfully mitigated without impairing the model
                            quality. We believe our work contributes to the pursuit of unbiased,
                            transparent, and ethical machine learning solutions for cyber-social health.

                            Cities around the world are expanding dramatically, with urban population
                            growth reaching nearly 2.5 billion people in urban areas and road traffic
                            growth exceeding 1.2 billion cars by 2050. The economic contribution of the
                            transport sector represents 5% of the GDP in Europe and costs an average of US
                            $482.05 billion in the United States. These figures indicate the rapid rise of
                            industrial cities and the urgent need to move from traditional cities to smart
                            cities. This article provides a survey of different approaches and technologies
                            such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that leverage communication
                            technologies to help maintain road users safe while driving, as well as support
                            autonomous mobility through the optimization of control systems. The role of
                            ITS is strengthened when combined with accurate artificial intelligence models
                            that are built to optimize urban planning, analyze crowd behavior and predict
                            traffic conditions. AI-driven ITS is becoming possible thanks to the existence
                            of a large volume of mobility data generated by billions of users through their
                            use of new technologies and online social media. The optimization of urban
                            planning enhances vehicle routing capabilities and solves traffic congestion
                            problems, as discussed in this paper. From an ecological perspective, we
                            discuss the measures and incentives provided to foster the use of mobility
                            systems. We also underline the role of the political will in promoting open
                            data in the transport sector, considered as an essential ingredient for
                            developing technological solutions necessary for cities to become healthier and
                            more sustainable.

                            Classification of crisis events, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks
                            and pandemics, is a crucial task to create early signals and inform relevant
                            parties for spontaneous actions to reduce overall damage. Despite crisis such
                            as natural disasters can be predicted by professional institutions, certain
                            events are first signaled by civilians, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemics.
                            Social media platforms such as Twitter often exposes firsthand signals on such
                            crises through high volume information exchange over half a billion tweets
                            posted daily. Prior works proposed various crisis embeddings and classification
                            using conventional Machine Learning and Neural Network models. However, none of
                            the works perform crisis embedding and classification using state of the art
                            attention-based deep neural networks models, such as Transformers and
                            document-level contextual embeddings. This work proposes CrisisBERT, an
                            end-to-end transformer-based model for two crisis classification tasks, namely
                            crisis detection and crisis recognition, which shows promising results across
                            accuracy and f1 scores. The proposed model also demonstrates superior
                            robustness over benchmark, as it shows marginal performance compromise while
                            extending from 6 to 36 events with only 51.4% additional data points. We also
                            proposed Crisis2Vec, an attention-based, document-level contextual embedding
                            architecture for crisis embedding, which achieve better performance than
                            conventional crisis embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe. To the best
                            of our knowledge, our works are first to propose using transformer-based crisis
                            classification and document-level contextual crisis embedding in the
                            literature.

                            Transformers \citep{vaswani2017attention} have gradually become a key
                            component for many state-of-the-art natural language representation models. A
                            recent Transformer based model- BERT \citep{devlin2018bert} achieved
                            state-of-the-art results on various natural language processing tasks,
                            including GLUE, SQuAD v1.1, and SQuAD v2.0. This model however is
                            computationally prohibitive and has a huge number of parameters. In this work
                            we revisit the architecture choices of BERT in efforts to obtain a lighter
                            model. We focus on reducing the number of parameters yet our methods can be
                            applied towards other objectives such FLOPs or latency. We show that much
                            efficient light BERT models can be obtained by reducing algorithmically chosen
                            correct architecture design dimensions rather than reducing the number of
                            Transformer encoder layers. In particular, our schuBERT gives $6.6\%$ higher
                            average accuracy on GLUE and SQuAD datasets as compared to BERT with three
                            encoder layers while having the same number of parameters.

                            Backscattering assisted wireless-powered communication combines
                            ultralow-power backscatter transmitters with energy harvesting devices. This
                            paper investigates the transmission mode selection problem of a hybrid relay
                            that forwards data by switching between the active wireless-powered
                            transmission and the passive ambient backscattering. It first presents a hybrid
                            relay system model and derives its end-to-end success probability under
                            theoretically optimal, but practically unrealistic, conditions. The
                            transmission mode selection is then formulated as a stochastic two-armed bandit
                            problem in a varying environment where the distributions of rewards are
                            nonstationary. The proposed model selection scheme does not assume to have
                            access to any channel states or network conditions, but merely relies on
                            learning from past transmission records. Numerical analyses are performed to
                            validate the proposed bandit-based mode selection approach.

                            information about medical visits, tests and procedures, as well as outcomes,
                            which together form individual patient journeys. By assessing the similarities
                            among these journeys, it is possible to uncover clusters of common disease
                            trajectories with shared health outcomes. The assignment of patient journeys to
                            specific clusters may in turn serve as the basis for personalized outcome
                            prediction and treatment selection. This procedure is a non-trivial
                            computational problem, as it requires the comparison of patient data with
                            multi-dimensional and multi-modal features that are captured at different times
                            and resolutions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the
                            tools and methods that are used in patient similarity analysis with
                            longitudinal data and discuss its potential for improving clinical decision
                            making.

                            The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread around the globe
                            in 2020, with the U.S. becoming the epicenter of COVID-19 cases and deaths in
                            late March. In this context, there have been federal and state-level policy
                            interventions aiming at mitigating the public health risks of this pandemic.
                            These social distancing and work-from-home policies, which vary widely across
                            states, have impacted the electricity sector, and economic productivity in
                            general. As the U.S. begins to gradually resume some economic and social
                            activities, it is imperative for policy makers and electric power operators to
                            take a data-driven scientific approach to understanding and predicting the
                            change of electricity consumption in the shorter and longer term. In this
                            paper, we release a first-of-its-kind open access data hub, namely the
                            Coronavirus Disease-Electricity Market Data Aggregation (COVID-EMDA), to track
                            the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on electricity markets in the U.S. This
                            ready-to-use data hub integrates generation, load and pricing data across all
                            existing U.S. markets with COVID-19 case data, weather data, cellular phone
                            location data and satellite imaging data into a compact format, and is updated
                            daily to capture the evolving dynamics. Additionally, we perform rigorous
                            statistical analysis of this data to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the
                            electricity sector. Our analysis suggests a strong correlation between the rise
                            in the number of COVID-19 cases and a reduction in the total load, especially
                            in the Northeast and Coastal regions of the U.S., which contains the majority
                            of the U.S.COVID-19 case load. We also uncover significant spatial variations
                            in the impact of COVID-19 on regional electricity markets, which may be
                            indicative of differing social distancing policies and case loads.

                            The automation of adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection in social media would
                            revolutionize the practice of pharmacovigilance, supporting drug regulators,
                            the pharmaceutical industry and the general public in ensuring the safety of
                            the drugs prescribed in daily practice. Following from the published
                            proceedings of the Social Media Mining for Health (SMM4H) Applications Workshop
                            &amp; Shared Task in August 2019, we aimed to develop a deep learning model to
                            classify ADRs within Twitter tweets that contain drug mentions. Our approach
                            involved fine-tuning $BERT_{LARGE}$ and two domain-specific BERT
                            implementations, $BioBERT$ and $Bio + clinicalBERT$, applying a domain-specific
                            preprocessor, and developing a max-prediction ensembling approach. Our final
                            model resulted in state-of-the-art performance on both $F_1$-score (0.6681) and
                            recall (0.7700) outperforming all models submitted in SMM4H 2019 and during

                            The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the
                            COVID-19 pandemic. Countries across the world are using digital technologies to
                            fight this global crisis. These digital technologies, in one way or another,
                            strongly rely on the availability of wireless communication technologies. In
                            this paper, we present the role of wireless communications in the COVID-19
                            pandemic from different perspectives. First, we show how these technologies are
                            helping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,
                            enabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and
                            conferencing. Also, we show the importance of digital inclusiveness in the
                            pandemic and possible solutions to connect the unconnected. Next, we discuss
                            the challenges faced by wireless technologies, including privacy, security, and
                            misinformation. Then, we present the importance of wireless communication
                            technologies in the survival of the global economy, such as automation of
                            industries and supply chain, e-commerce, and supporting occupations that are at
                            risk. Finally, we reveal that how the technologies developed during the
                            pandemic can be helpful in the post-pandemic era.

                            What computational principles underlie human pragmatic reasoning? A prominent
                            approach to pragmatics is the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
                            formulates pragmatic reasoning as probabilistic speakers and listeners
                            recursively reasoning about each other. While RSA enjoys broad empirical
                            support, it is not yet clear whether the dynamics of such recursive reasoning
                            may be governed by a general optimization principle. Here, we present a novel
                            analysis of the RSA framework that addresses this question. First, we show that
                            RSA recursion implements an alternating maximization for optimizing a tradeoff
                            between expected utility and communicative effort. On that basis, we study the
                            dynamics of RSA recursion and disconfirm the conjecture that expected utility
                            is guaranteed to improve with recursion depth. Second, we show that RSA can be
                            grounded in Rate-Distortion theory, while maintaining a similar ability to
                            account for human behavior and avoiding a bias of RSA toward random utterance
                            production. This work furthers the mathematical understanding of RSA models,
                            and suggests that general information-theoretic principles may give rise to
                            human pragmatic reasoning.

                            Programmatic advertising operates one of the most sophisticated and efficient
                            service platforms on the Internet. However, the complexity of this ecosystem is
                            the main cause of one of the most important problems in online advertising, the
                            lack of transparency. This lack of transparency leads to subsequent problems
                            such as advertising fraud, which causes billions of dollars in losses.
                            <br />In this paper we propose Ads.chain, a technological solution to the
                            lack-of-transparency problem in programmatic advertising. Ads.chain extends the
                            current effort of the IAB in providing traceability in online advertising
                            through the Ads.txt and Ads.cert solutions, addressing the limitations of these
                            techniques. Ads.chain is a communication protocol that provides end-to-end
                            cryptographic traceability at the ad transaction level. It can be seamlessly
                            embedded in ad-tags and the OpenRTB protocol, the de-facto standards for
                            communications in online advertising, allowing an incremental adoption by the
                            industry.
                            <br />We have implemented the protocol and made the code publicly available. We
                            assess the performance of Ads.chain through a thorough analysis in a lab
                            environment that emulates a real ad delivery process. The obtained results show
                            that our protocol adds delays lower than 0.25 ms per ad space on the web page
                            and a marginal delay of 0.8 ms on the intermediaries. These results confirm its
                            impact on the user experience and the overall operation of the programmatic ad
                            delivery process can be considered negligible.

                            The problem of "debloating" programs for security and performance purposes
                            has begun to see increased attention. Of particular interest in many
                            environments is debloating commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) software, which is
                            most commonly made available to end users as stripped binaries (i.e., neither
                            source code nor symbol-table/debugging information is available). Toward this
                            end, we created a system, called \toolname, that specializes stripped binaries.
                            <br />Many aspects of the debloating problem can be addressed via techniques from
                            the literature on partial evaluation. However, applying such techniques to
                            real-world programs, particularly stripped binaries, involves non-trivial
                            state-management manipulations that have never been addressed in a completely
                            satisfactory manner in previous systems. In particular, a partial evaluator
                            needs to be able to (i) save and restore arbitrary program states, and (ii)
                            determine whether a program state is equal to one that arose earlier. Moreover,
                            to specialize stripped binaries, the system must also be able to handle program
                            states consisting of memory that is undifferentiated beyond the standard coarse
                            division into regions for the stack, the heap, and global data.
                            <br />This paper presents a new approach to state management in a program
                            specializer. The technique has been incorporated into GenXGen[MC], a novel tool
                            for producing machine-code generating extensions. Our experiments show that our
                            solution to issue (i) significantly decreases the space required to represent
                            program states, and our solution to issue (ii) drastically improves the time
                            for producing a specialized program (as much as 13,000x speedup).

                            A plethora of research has been done in the past focusing on predicting
                            student's performance in order to support their development. Many institutions
                            are focused on improving the performance and the education quality; and this
                            can be achieved by utilizing data mining techniques to analyze and predict
                            students' performance and to determine possible factors that may affect their
                            final marks. To address this issue, this work starts by thoroughly exploring
                            and analyzing two different datasets at two separate stages of course delivery
                            (20 percent and 50 percent respectively) using multiple graphical, statistical,
                            and quantitative techniques. The feature analysis provides insights into the
                            nature of the different features considered and helps in the choice of the
                            machine learning algorithms and their parameters. Furthermore, this work
                            proposes a systematic approach based on Gini index and p-value to select a
                            suitable ensemble learner from a combination of six potential machine learning
                            algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble models achieve
                            high accuracy and low false positive rate at all stages for both datasets.

                            A hallmark of graph neural networks is their ability to distinguish the
                            isomorphism class of their inputs. This study derives the first hardness
                            results for graph isomorphism in the message-passing model (MPNN). MPNN
                            encompasses the majority of graph neural networks used today and is universal
                            in the limit when nodes are given unique features. The analysis relies on the
                            introduced measure of communication capacity. Capacity measures how much
                            information the nodes of a network can exchange during the forward pass and
                            depends on the depth, message-size, global state, and width of the
                            architecture. It is shown that the capacity of MPNN needs to grow linearly with
                            the number of nodes so that a network can distinguish trees and quadratically
                            for general connected graphs. Crucially, the derived bounds are applicable not
                            only to worst-case instances but over a portion of all inputs. An empirical
                            study involving 12 tasks of varying difficulty and 420 networks reveals strong
                            alignment between actual performance and theoretical predictions.

                            'woman rides motorcycle') unlike single objects (e.g. 'woman' or 'motorcycle').
                            Retrieval using structured queries therefore is much more useful than single
                            object retrieval, but a much more challenging problem. In this paper we present
                            a method which uses scene graph embeddings as the basis for an approach to
                            image retrieval. We examine how visual relationships, derived from scene
                            graphs, can be used as structured queries. The visual relationships are
                            directed subgraphs of the scene graph with a subject and object as nodes
                            connected by a predicate relationship. Notably, we are able to achieve high
                            recall even on low to medium frequency objects found in the long-tailed
                            COCO-Stuff dataset, and find that adding a visual relationship-inspired loss
                            boosts our recall by 10% in the best case.

                            We propose the first practical multitask image enhancement network, that is
                            able to learn one-to-many and many-to-one image mappings. We show that our
                            model outperforms the current state of the art in learning a single enhancement
                            mapping, while having significantly fewer parameters than its competitors.
                            Furthermore, the model achieves even higher performance on learning multiple
                            mappings simultaneously, by taking advantage of shared representations. Our
                            network is based on the recently proposed SGN architecture, with modifications
                            targeted at incorporating global features and style adaption. Finally, we
                            present an unpaired learning method for multitask image enhancement, that is
                            based on generative adversarial networks (GANs).

                            In this work, we study bounds on the capacity of full-duplex Gaussian 1-2-1
                            networks with imperfect beamforming. In particular, different from the ideal
                            1-2-1 network model introduced in [1], in this model beamforming patterns
                            result in side-lobe leakage that cannot be perfectly suppressed. The 1-2-1
                            network model captures the directivity of mmWave network communications, where
                            nodes communicate by pointing main-lobe "beams" at each other. We characterize

                            models for the same channel coefficients and transmit power. We show that,

                            implementation.

                            The first-order theory of finite and infinite trees has been studied since
                            the eighties, especially by the logic programming community. Following
                            Djelloul, Dao and Fr\"uhwirth, we consider an extension of this theory with an
                            additional predicate for finiteness of trees, which is useful for expressing
                            properties about (not just datatypes but also) codatatypes. Based on their
                            work, we present a simplification procedure that determines whether any given
                            (not necessarily closed) formula is satisfiable, returning a simplified formula
                            which enables one to read off all possible models. Our extension makes the
                            algorithm usable for algebraic (co)datatypes, which was impossible in their
                            original work due to restrictive assumptions. We also provide a prototype
                            implementation of our simplification procedure and evaluate it on instances
                            from the SMT-LIB.

                            Public blockchains should be able to scale with respect to the number of
                            nodes and to the transactions load. Despite the large research and experimental
                            effort, all known approaches turn out to be tradeoffs that sacrifice security
                            or decentralization to achieve scalability. Actually, the blockchain
                            scalability trilemma has been informally proposed. This is related to
                            scalability, security and decentralization, stating that any improvement in one
                            of these aspects should negatively impact on at least one of the other two
                            aspects.
                            <br />We introduce a new blockchain architecture that scales to arbitrarily high
                            transactions workload provided that a corresponding proportional increment of
                            nodes is provided. In this scalability process, no tradeoff on security or
                            decentralization is required. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
                            result of this kind. While our result is currently only theoretic, we believe
                            that our approach could stimulate significant practical contributions.

                            In this paper, we introduce the notion of the cost of guessing and provide an
                            optimal strategy for guessing a random variable taking values on a finite set
                            whereby each choice may be associated with a positive finite cost value.
                            Moreover, we drive asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the moments
                            of cost of guessing problem. Similar to previous studies on the standard
                            guesswork, established bounds on the moments quantify the accumulated cost of
                            guesses required for correctly identifying the unknown choice and are expressed
                            in terms of the R\'enyi's entropy. A new random variable is introduced to
                            bridge between the cost of guessing and the standard guesswork. Finally, we
                            establish the guessing cost exponent on the moments of the optimal guessing by
                            considering a sequence of random variables. Furthermore, these bounds are shown
                            to serve quite useful for bounding the overall repair latency cost (data repair
                            complexity) for distributed data storage systems in which sparse graph codes
                            may be utilized.

                            In this paper, we consider the transformation of laser range measurements
                            into a top-view grid map representation to approach the task of LiDAR-only
                            semantic segmentation. Since the recent publication of the SemanticKITTI data
                            set, researchers are now able to study semantic segmentation of urban LiDAR
                            sequences based on a reasonable amount of data. While other approaches propose
                            to directly learn on the 3D point clouds, we are exploiting a grid map
                            framework to extract relevant information and represent them by using
                            multi-layer grid maps. This representation allows us to use well-studied deep
                            learning architectures from the image domain to predict a dense semantic grid
                            map using only the sparse input data of a single LiDAR scan. We compare
                            single-layer and multi-layer approaches and demonstrate the benefit of a
                            multi-layer grid map input. Since the grid map representation allows us to
                            predict a dense, 360{\deg} semantic environment representation, we further
                            develop a method to combine the semantic information from multiple scans and
                            create dense ground truth grids. This method allows us to evaluate and compare
                            the performance of our models not only based on grid cells with a detection,
                            but on the full visible measurement range.

                            We present a simple, novel method of efficiently rendering ray cast soft
                            shadows on curved terrain by using dynamic programming and maximum mipmaps to
                            rapidly find a global minimum shadow cost in constant runtime complexity.
                            Additionally, we apply a new method of reducing view ray computation times that
                            pre-displaces the terrain mesh to bootstrap ray starting positions. Combining
                            these two methods, our ray casting engine runs in real-time with more than 200%
                            speed up over uniform ray stepping with comparable image quality and without
                            hardware ray tracing acceleration. To add support for accurate planetary
                            ephemerides and interactive features, we integrated the engine into
                            celestia.Sci, a general space simulation software. We demonstrate the ability
                            of our engine to accurately handle a large range of distance scales by using it
                            to generate videos of lunar landing trajectories. The numerical error when
                            compared with real lunar mission imagery is small, demonstrating the accuracy
                            and efficiency of our approach.

                            Modern deep learning models for NLP are notoriously opaque. This has
                            motivated the development of methods for interpreting such models, e.g., via
                            gradient-based saliency maps or the visualization of attention weights. Such
                            approaches aim to provide explanations for a particular model prediction by
                            highlighting important words in the corresponding input text. While this might
                            be useful for tasks where decisions are explicitly influenced by individual
                            tokens in the input, we suspect that such highlighting is not suitable for
                            tasks where model decisions should be driven by more complex reasoning. In this
                            work, we investigate the use of influence functions for NLP, providing an
                            alternative approach to interpreting neural text classifiers. Influence
                            functions explain the decisions of a model by identifying influential training
                            examples. Despite the promise of this approach, influence functions have not
                            yet been extensively evaluated in the context of NLP, a gap addressed by this
                            work. We conduct a comparison between influence functions and common
                            word-saliency methods on representative tasks. As suspected, we find that
                            influence functions are particularly useful for natural language inference, a
                            task in which 'saliency maps' may not have clear interpretation. Furthermore,
                            we develop a new quantitative measure based on influence functions that can
                            reveal artifacts in training data.

                            function approximator, one usually uses the method based on the nonlinear
                            activation function or the nonlinear kernel function and yields classical
                            networks such as the feed-forward neural network (MLP) and the radial basis
                            function network (RBF). Although, classical networks such as the MLP are robust
                            in most of the classification task, they are not the most efficient. E.g., they
                            use large amount of parameters and take long times to train. Additionally, the
                            choice of activation functions has a non-negligible influence on the
                            effectiveness and efficiency of the network. In this paper, we propose a new
                            network that is efficient in finding the function that maps the feature to the
                            label. Instead of using the nonlinear activation function, the new proposed
                            network uses the fractional form to overcome the nonlinearity, thus for the
                            sake of convenience, we name the network the ratio net. We compare the
                            effectiveness and efficiency of the ratio net and the classical networks such
                            as the MLP and the RBF in the classification task on the mnist database of
                            handwritten digits and the IMDb dataset which is a binary sentiment analysis
                            dataset. The result shows that the ratio net outperforms both the MLP and the
                            RBF.

                            We describe a technique for systematic testing of multi-threaded programs. We
                            combine Quasi-Optimal Partial-Order Reduction, a state-of-the-art technique
                            that tackles path explosion due to interleaving non-determinism, with symbolic
                            execution to handle data non-determinism. Our technique iteratively and
                            exhaustively finds all executions of the program. It represents program
                            executions using partial orders and finds the next execution using an
                            underlying unfolding semantics. We avoid the exploration of redundant program
                            traces using cutoff events. We implemented our technique as an extension of
                            KLEE and evaluated it on a set of large multi-threaded C programs. Our
                            experiments found several previously undiscovered bugs and undefined behaviors
                            in memcached and GNU sort, showing that the new method is capable of finding

                            In e-commerce system, category prediction is to automatically predict
                            categories of given texts. Different from traditional classification where
                            there are no relations between classes, category prediction is reckoned as a
                            standard hierarchical classification problem since categories are usually
                            organized as a hierarchical tree. In this paper, we address hierarchical
                            category prediction. We propose a Deep Hierarchical Classification framework,
                            which incorporates the multi-scale hierarchical information in neural networks
                            and introduces a representation sharing strategy according to the category
                            tree. We also define a novel combined loss function to punish hierarchical
                            prediction losses. The evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms
                            existing approaches in accuracy.

                            An accelerated class of adaptive scheme of iterative thresholding algorithms
                            is studied analytically and empirically. They are based on the feedback
                            mechanism of the null space tuning techniques (NST+HT+FB). The main
                            contribution of this article is the accelerated convergence analysis and proofs
                            with a variable/adaptive index selection and different feedback principles at
                            each iteration. These convergence analysis require no longer a priori sparsity
                            information $s$ of a signal. %key theory in this paper is the concept that the
                            number of indices selected at each iteration should be considered in order to
                            speed up the convergence. It is shown that uniform recovery of all $s$-sparse
                            signals from given linear measurements can be achieved under reasonable
                            (preconditioned) restricted isometry conditions. Accelerated convergence rate
                            and improved convergence conditions are obtained by selecting an appropriate
                            size of the index support per iteration. The theoretical findings are
                            sufficiently demonstrated and confirmed by extensive numerical experiments. It
                            is also observed that the proposed algorithms have a clearly advantageous
                            balance of efficiency, adaptivity and accuracy compared with all other
                            state-of-the-art greedy iterative algorithms.

                            environments, relying on local obstacle sensing. We consider a control-affine
                            nonlinear robot system subject to bounded input noise and rely on feedback
                            linearization to determine ellipsoid output bounds on the closed-loop robot
                            trajectory under stabilizing control. A virtual governor system is developed to
                            adaptively track a desired navigation path, while relying on the robot
                            trajectory bounds to slow down if safety is endangered and speed up otherwise.
                            The main contribution is the derivation of theoretical guarantees for safe

                            The travelling thief problem (TTP) is a multi-component optimisation problem
                            involving two interdependent NP-hard components: the travelling salesman
                            problem (TSP) and the knapsack problem (KP). Recent state-of-the-art TTP
                            solvers modify the underlying TSP and KP solutions in an iterative and
                            interleaved fashion. The TSP solution (cyclic tour) is typically changed in a
                            deterministic way, while changes to the KP solution typically involve a random
                            search, effectively resulting in a quasi-meandering exploration of the TTP
                            solution space. Once a plateau is reached, the iterative search of the TTP
                            solution space is restarted by using a new initial TSP tour. We propose to make
                            the search more efficient through an adaptive surrogate model (based on a
                            customised form of Support Vector Regression) that learns the characteristics
                            of initial TSP tours that lead to good TTP solutions. The model is used to
                            filter out non-promising initial TSP tours, in effect reducing the amount of
                            time spent to find a good TTP solution. Experiments on a broad range of
                            benchmark TTP instances indicate that the proposed approach filters out a
                            considerable number of non-promising initial tours, at the cost of omitting
                            only a small number of the best TTP solutions.

                            An IoT (Internet of things) system supports a massive number of IoT devices
                            wirelessly. We show how to use Cell-Free Massive MIMO (multiple-input and
                            multiple-output) to provide a scalable and energy efficient IoT system. We
                            employ optimal linear estimation with random pilots to acquire CSI (channel
                            state information) for MIMO precoding and decoding. In the uplink, we employ
                            optimal linear decoder and utilize RM (random matrix) theory to obtain two
                            accurate SINR (signal-to-interference plus noise ratio) approximations
                            involving only large-scale fading coefficients. We derive several max-min type
                            power control algorithms based on both exact SINR expression and RM
                            approximations. These algorithms incorporate power and rate weighting functions
                            and can achieve an assigned target rate with high energy efficiency. For the
                            downlink, we employ maximum ratio precoding. To avoid solving a time-consuming
                            quasi-concave problem that requires repeat tests for feasibility of a SOCP
                            (second-order cone programming) problem, we develop a neural network (NN) aided
                            power control algorithm that results in 30 times reduction in computation time.
                            A scalable sub-optimal power control algorithm incorporating NN is also
                            obtained for large systems.

                            A single diode model with five parameters is the simplest and robust approach
                            for modeling a photovoltaic (PV) module in a simulated environment. These
                            parameters need to be accurately extracted from the specifications given in the
                            datasheet of the PV module such that the simulation model should exhibit the
                            same characteristics as the actual measurements. A definite set of five
                            independent equations, that should represent the characteristics of the PV
                            module as accurately as possible, is needed to solve for these five parameters.
                            In literature, the first four equations are easily created from the key data
                            points on the characteristic curve given in the datasheet of the PV module. The
                            main challenge however is the formulation of the fifth equation. The approaches
                            found in literature have inherent inaccuracies due to some approximations or
                            iterative techniques leading to discrepancy in the simulated model. This paper
                            presents a unique analytical approach for the formulation of the fifth equation
                            which yields the most accurate single diode model. As evident from the results,
                            the proposed method is superior to not just the single diode model approaches
                            but also to the double diode ones in simulating the characteristics of the PV
                            module with least error.

                            Accurate numerical simulations of interaction between fluid and solid play an
                            important role in applications. The task is challenging in practical scenarios
                            as the media are usually highly heterogeneous with very large contrast. To
                            overcome this computational challenge, various multiscale methods are
                            developed. In this paper, we consider a class of linear poroelasticity problems
                            in high contrast heterogeneous porous media, and develop a mixed generalized
                            multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) to obtain a fast computational
                            method. Our aim is to develop a multiscale method that is robust with respect
                            to the heterogeneities and contrast of the media, and gives a mass conservative
                            fluid velocity field. We will construct decoupled multiscale basis functions
                            for the elastic displacement as well as fluid velocity. Our multiscale basis
                            functions are local. The construction is based on some suitable choices of
                            local snapshot spaces and local spectral decomposition, with the goal of
                            extracting dominant modes of the solutions. For the pressure, we will use
                            piecewise constant approximation. We will present several numerical examples to
                            illustrate the performance of our method. Our results indicate that the
                            proposed method is able to give accurate numerical solutions with a small
                            degree of freedoms.

                            Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are regarded as key enablers of
                            next-generation wireless communications, due to their capability of customizing
                            the wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate
                            power-efficient resource allocation for IRS-assisted multiuser multiple-input
                            single-output (MISO) systems. To minimize the transmit power, both the
                            beamforming vectors at the access point (AP) and phase shifts at the IRS are
                            jointly optimized while taking into account the minimum required
                            quality-of-service (QoS) of the users. To tackle the non-convexity of the
                            formulated optimization problem, an inner approximation (IA) algorithm is
                            developed. Unlike existing designs, which cannot guarantee local optimality,
                            the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
                            solution. Our simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed
                            algorithm compared to baseline schemes and reveal that deploying IRSs is more
                            promising than leveraging multiple antennas at the AP in terms of energy
                            efficiency.

                            Parallelism is a ubiquitous method for accelerating machine learning
                            algorithms. However, theoretical analysis of parallel learning is usually done
                            in an algorithm- and protocol-specific setting, giving little insight about how
                            changes in the structure of communication could affect convergence. In this
                            paper we propose MixML, a general framework for analyzing convergence of weakly
                            consistent parallel machine learning. Our framework includes: (1) a unified way
                            of modeling the communication process among parallel workers; (2) a new
                            parameter, the mixing time tmix, that quantifies how the communication process
                            affects convergence; and (3) a principled way of converting a convergence proof
                            for a sequential algorithm into one for a parallel version that depends only on
                            tmix. We show MixML recovers and improves on known convergence bounds for
                            asynchronous and/or decentralized versions of many algorithms, includingSGD and
                            AMSGrad. Our experiments substantiate the theory and show the dependency of
                            convergence on the underlying mixing time.

                            In the generator of typical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a noise
                            is inputted to generate fake samples via a series of convolutional operations.
                            However, current noise generation models merely relies on the information from
                            the pixel space, which increases the difficulty to approach the target
                            distribution. Fortunately, the long proven wavelet transformation is able to
                            decompose multiple spectral information from the images. In this work, we
                            propose a novel multi-channel wavelet-based filtering method for GANs, to cope
                            with this problem. When embedding a wavelet deconvolution layer in the
                            generator, the resultant GAN, called WaveletGAN, takes advantage of the wavelet
                            deconvolution to learn a filtering with multiple channels, which can
                            efficiently homogenize the generated noise via an averaging operation, so as to
                            generate high-fidelity samples. We conducted benchmark experiments on the
                            Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST and SVHN datasets through an open GAN benchmark tool. The
                            results show that WaveletGAN has excellent performance in generating
                            high-fidelity samples, thanks to the smallest FIDs obtained on these datasets.

                            A hover-capable insect-inspired flying robot that can remain long in the air
                            has shown its potential use for both confined indoor and outdoor applications
                            to complete assigned tasks. In this letter, we report improvements in the
                            flight endurance of our 15.8 g robot, named KUBeetle-S, using a low-voltage
                            power source. The robot is equipped with a simple but effective control
                            mechanism that can modulate the stroke plane for attitude stabilization and
                            control. Due to the demand for extended flight, we performed a series of
                            experiments on the lift generation and power requirement of the robot with
                            different stroke amplitudes and wing areas. We show that a larger wing with
                            less inboard wing area improves the lift-to-power ratio and produces a peak
                            lift-to-weight ratio of 1.34 at 3.7 V application. Flight tests show that the
                            robot employing the selected wing could hover for 8.8 minutes. Moreover, the
                            robot could perform maneuvers in any direction and fly outdoors, demonstrating
                            its ability to enter the next phase of autonomous flight.

                            The privacy of data is a major challenge in machine learning as a trained
                            model may expose sensitive information of the enclosed dataset. Besides, the
                            limited computation capability and capacity of edge devices have made
                            cloud-hosted inference inevitable. Sending private information to remote
                            servers makes the privacy of inference also vulnerable because of susceptible
                            communication channels or even untrustworthy hosts. In this paper, we target
                            privacy-preserving training and inference of brain-inspired Hyperdimensional
                            (HD) computing, a new learning algorithm that is gaining traction due to its
                            light-weight computation and robustness particularly appealing for edge devices
                            with tight constraints. Indeed, despite its promising attributes, HD computing
                            has virtually no privacy due to its reversible computation. We present an
                            accuracy-privacy trade-off method through meticulous quantization and pruning
                            of hypervectors, the building blocks of HD, to realize a differentially private
                            model as well as to obfuscate the information sent for cloud-hosted inference.
                            Finally, we show how the proposed techniques can be also leveraged for
                            efficient hardware implementation.

                            Tremendous research efforts have been made to thrive deep domain adaptation
                            (DA) by seeking domain-invariant features. Most existing deep DA models only
                            focus on aligning feature representations of task-specific layers across
                            domains while integrating a totally shared convolutional architecture for
                            source and target. However, we argue that such strongly-shared convolutional
                            layers might be harmful for domain-specific feature learning when source and
                            target data distribution differs to a large extent. In this paper, we relax a
                            shared-convnets assumption made by previous DA methods and propose a Domain
                            Conditioned Adaptation Network (DCAN), which aims to excite distinct
                            convolutional channels with a domain conditioned channel attention mechanism.
                            As a result, the critical low-level domain-dependent knowledge could be
                            explored appropriately. As far as we know, this is the first work to explore
                            the domain-wise convolutional channel activation for deep DA networks.
                            Moreover, to effectively align high-level feature distributions across two
                            domains, we further deploy domain conditioned feature correction blocks after
                            task-specific layers, which will explicitly correct the domain discrepancy.
                            Extensive experiments on three cross-domain benchmarks demonstrate the proposed
                            approach outperforms existing methods by a large margin, especially on very
                            tough cross-domain learning tasks.

                            Motion planning for vehicles under the influence of flow fields can benefit
                            from the idea of streamline-based planning, which exploits ideas from fluid
                            dynamics to achieve computational efficiency. Important to such planners is an
                            efficient means of computing the travel distance and direction between two
                            points in free space, but this is difficult to achieve in strong incompressible
                            flows such as ocean currents. We propose two useful distance functions in
                            analytical form that combine Euclidean distance with values of the stream
                            function associated with a flow field, and with an estimation of the strength
                            of the opposing flow between two points. Further, we propose steering
                            heuristics that are useful for steering towards a sampled point. We evaluate
                            these ideas by integrating them with RRT* and comparing the algorithm's
                            performance with state-of-the-art methods in an artificial flow field and in
                            actual ocean prediction data in the region of the dominant East Australian
                            Current between Sydney and Brisbane. Results demonstrate the method's
                            computational efficiency and ability to find high-quality paths outperforming
                            state-of-the-art methods, and show promise for practical use with autonomous
                            marine robots.

                            We study the combinatorial sleeping multi-armed semi-bandit problem with
                            long-term fairness constraints~(CSMAB-F). To address the problem, we adopt
                            Thompson Sampling~(TS) to maximize the total rewards and use virtual queue
                            techniques to handle the fairness constraints, and design an algorithm called
                            \emph{TS with beta priors and Bernoulli likelihoods for CSMAB-F~(TSCSF-B)}.
                            Further, we prove TSCSF-B can satisfy the fairness constraints, and the
                            time-averaged regret is upper bounded by $\frac{N}{2\eta} +
                            O\left(\frac{\sqrt{mNT\ln T}}{T}\right)$, where $N$ is the total number of
                            arms, $m$ is the maximum number of arms that can be pulled simultaneously in
                            each round~(the cardinality constraint) and $\eta$ is the parameter trading off
                            fairness for rewards. By relaxing the fairness constraints (i.e., let $\eta
                            \rightarrow \infty$), the bound boils down to the first problem-independent
                            bound of TS algorithms for combinatorial sleeping multi-armed semi-bandit
                            problems. Finally, we perform numerical experiments and use a high-rating movie

                            proposed algorithm.

                            The Word Mover's Distance (WMD) is a metric that measures the semantic
                            dissimilarity between two text documents by computing the cost of moving all
                            words of a source/query document to the most similar words of a target document
                            optimally. Computing WMD between two documents is costly because it requires
                            solving an optimization problem that costs \(O(V^3log(V))\) where \(d\) is the
                            number of unique words in the document. Fortunately, the WMD can be framed as
                            the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) (also known as the Optimal Transportation
                            Distance) for which it has been shown that the algorithmic complexity can be
                            reduced to \(O(V^2)\) by adding an entropy penalty to the optimization problem
                            and a similar idea can be adapted to compute WMD efficiently. Additionally, the
                            computation can be made highly parallel by computing WMD of a single query
                            document against multiple target documents at once (e.g., finding whether a
                            given tweet is similar to any other tweets happened in a day). In this paper,
                            we present a shared-memory parallel Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm to compute the WMD
                            of one document against many other documents by adopting the \(O(V^2)\) EMD
                            algorithm. We used algorithmic transformations to change the original dense
                            compute-heavy kernel to a sparse compute kernel and obtained \(67\times\)
                            speedup using \(96\) cores on the state-of-the-art of Intel\textregistered{}
                            4-sockets Cascade Lake machine w.r.t. its sequential run. Our parallel
                            algorithm is over \(700\times\) faster than the naive parallel python code that
                            internally uses optimized matrix library calls.

                            The training of modern deep learning neural network calls for large amounts
                            of computation, which is often provided by GPUs or other specific accelerators.
                            To scale out to achieve faster training speed, two update algorithms are mainly
                            applied in the distributed training process, i.e. the Synchronous SGD algorithm
                            (SSGD) and Asynchronous SGD algorithm (ASGD). SSGD obtains good convergence
                            point while the training speed is slowed down by the synchronous barrier. ASGD
                            has faster training speed but the convergence point is lower when compared to
                            SSGD. To sufficiently utilize the advantages of SSGD and ASGD, we propose a
                            novel technology named One-step Delay SGD (OD-SGD) to combine their strengths
                            in the training process. Therefore, we can achieve similar convergence point
                            and training speed as SSGD and ASGD separately. To the best of our knowledge,
                            we make the first attempt to combine the features of SSGD and ASGD to improve
                            distributed training performance. Each iteration of OD-SGD contains a global
                            update in the parameter server node and local updates in the worker nodes, the
                            local update is introduced to update and compensate the delayed local weights.
                            We evaluate our proposed algorithm on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.
                            Experimental results show that OD-SGD can obtain similar or even slightly
                            better accuracy than SSGD, while its training speed is much faster, which even
                            exceeds the training speed of ASGD.

                            To successfully build a deep learning model, it will need a large amount of
                            labeled data. However, labeled data are hard to collect in many use cases. To
                            tackle this problem, a bunch of data augmentation methods have been introduced
                            recently and have demonstrated successful results in computer vision, natural
                            language and so on. For financial trading data, to our best knowledge,
                            successful data augmentation framework has rarely been studied. Here we propose
                            a Modified Local Search Attack Sampling method to augment the candlestick data,
                            which is a very important tool for professional trader. Our results show that
                            the proposed method can generate high-quality data which are hard to
                            distinguish by human and will open a new way for finance community to employ
                            existing machine learning techniques even if the dataset is small.

                            In this paper, the Green's function and decomposition technique is proposed
                            for solving the coupled Lane-Emden equations. This approach depends on
                            constructing Green's function before establishing the recursive scheme for the

                            Point cloud analysis is attracting attention from Artificial Intelligence
                            research since it can be extensively applied for robotics, Augmented Reality,
                            self-driving, etc. However, it is always challenging due to problems such as
                            irregularities, unorderedness, and sparsity. In this article, we propose a
                            novel network named Dense-Resolution Network for point cloud analysis. This
                            network is designed to learn local point features from point cloud in different
                            resolutions. In order to learn local point groups more intelligently, we
                            present a novel grouping algorithm for local neighborhood searching and an
                            effective error-minimizing model for capturing local features. In addition to
                            validating the network on widely used point cloud segmentation and
                            classification benchmarks, we also test and visualize the performances of the
                            components. Comparing with other state-of-the-art methods, our network shows
                            superiority.

                            Feature extraction and description is an important topic of computer vision,
                            as it is the starting point of a number of tasks such as image reconstruction,
                            stitching, registration, and recognition among many others. In this paper, two
                            new image features are proposed: the Information Ratio (IR) and the Mutual
                            Information Ratio (MIR). The IR is a feature of a single image, while the MIR
                            describes features common across two or more images.We begin by introducing the
                            IR and the MIR and motivate these features in an information theoretical
                            context as the ratio of the self-information of an intensity level over the
                            information contained over the pixels of the same intensity. Notably, the
                            relationship of the IR and MIR with the image entropy and mutual information,
                            classic information measures, are discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of
                            these features is tested through feature extraction over INRIA Copydays
                            datasets and feature matching over the Oxfords Affine Covariant Regions. These
                            numerical evaluations validate the relevance of the IR and MIR in practical
                            computer vision tasks

                            Proxy re-encryption (PRE) securely enables the re-encryption of ciphertexts
                            from one key to another, without relying on trusted parties, i.e., it offers
                            delegation of decryption rights. PRE allows a semi-trusted third party termed
                            as a "proxy" to securely divert encrypted files of user A (delegator) to user B
                            (delegatee) without revealing any information about the underlying files to the
                            proxy. To eliminate the necessity of having a costly certificate verification
                            process, Green and Ateniese introduced an identity-based PRE (IB-PRE). The
                            potential applicability of IB-PRE leads to intensive research from its first
                            instantiation. Unfortunately, till today, there is no unidirectional IB-PRE
                            secure in the standard model, which can withstand quantum attack. In this
                            paper, we provide, for the first time, a concrete construction of
                            unidirectional IB-PRE which is secure in standard model based on the hardness
                            of learning with error problem. Our technique is to use the novel trapdoor
                            delegation technique of Micciancio and Peikert. The way we use trapdoor
                            delegation technique may prove useful for functionalities other than proxy
                            re-encryption as well.

                            In this article we present a modification of the algorithm for data
                            discretized in the point values introduced in [S. Amat, J. Ruiz, C.-W. Shu, On
                            a new WENO algorithm of order 2r with improved accuracy close to
                            discontinuities, App. Math. Lett. 105 (2020), 106-298]. In the aforementioned
                            work, we managed to obtain an algorithm that reaches a progressive and optimal
                            order of accuracy close to discontinuities for WENO-6. For higher orders, i.e.
                            WENO-8, WENO-10, etc. We have found that the previous algorithm presents some
                            shadows in the detection of discontinuities, meaning that the order of accuracy
                            is better than the one attained by WENO of the same order, but not optimal. In
                            this article we present a modification of the smoothness indicators used in the
                            original algorithm, oriented to solve this problem and to attain a WENO-2r
                            algorithm with progressive order of accuracy close to the discontinuities. We
                            also present proofs for the accuracy and explicit formulas for all the weights
                            used for any order 2r of the algorithm.

                            report, we describe the experience of organizing the ECIR 2020 Workshops in
                            this scenario from two perspectives: the workshop organizers and the workshop
                            participants. We provide a report on the organizational aspect of these events
                            and the consequences for participants. Covering the scientific dimension of
                            each workshop is outside the scope of this article.

                            We present a new approach to conformance testing of black-box reactive
                            systems. We consider system specifications written as linear temporal logic
                            formulas to generate tests as sequences of input/output pairs: inputs are
                            extracted from the Buchi automata corresponding to the specifications, and
                            outputs are obtained by feeding the inputs to the systems. Conformance is
                            checked by comparing input/output sequences with automata traces to detect
                            violations of the specifications. We consider several criteria for extracting
                            tests and for stopping generation, and we compare them experimentally using
                            both indicators of coverage and error-detection. The results show that our
                            methodology can generate test suites with good system coverage and
                            error-detection capability.

                            OCR algorithms have received a significant improvement in performance
                            recently, mainly due to the increase in the capabilities of artificial
                            intelligence algorithms. However, this advancement is not evenly distributed
                            over all languages. Urdu is among the languages which did not receive much
                            attention, especially in the font independent perspective. There exists no
                            automated system that can reliably recognize printed Urdu text in images and
                            videos across different fonts. To help bridge this gap, we have developed
                            Qaida, a large scale data set with 256 fonts, and a complete Urdu lexicon. We
                            have also developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification
                            model which can recognize Urdu ligatures with 84.2% accuracy. Moreover, we
                            demonstrate that our recognition network can not only recognize the text in the
                            fonts it is trained on but can also reliably recognize text in unseen (new)
                            fonts. To this end, this paper makes following contributions: (i) we introduce
                            a large scale, multiple fonts based data set for printed Urdu text
                            recognition;(ii) we have designed, trained and evaluated a CNN based model for
                            Urdu text recognition; (iii) we experiment with incremental learning methods to
                            produce state-of-the-art results for Urdu text recognition. All the experiment
                            choices were thoroughly validated via detailed empirical analysis. We believe
                            that this study can serve as the basis for further improvement in the
                            performance of font independent Urdu OCR systems.

                            In super-resolution it is necessary to locate with high precision point
                            sources from noisy observations of the spectrum of the signal at low
                            frequencies capped by f_c. In the case when the point sources are positive and
                            are located on a grid, it has been recently established that the
                            super-resolution problem can be solved via linear programming in a stable
                            manner and that the method is nearly optimal in the minimax sense. The quality
                            of the reconstruction critically depends on the Rayleigh regularity of the
                            support of the signal; that is, on the maximum number of sources that can occur
                            within an interval of side length about 1/f_c. This work extends the earlier
                            result and shows that the conclusion continues to hold when the locations of
                            the point sources are arbitrary, i.e., the grid is arbitrarily fine. The proof
                            relies on new interpolation constructions in Fourier analysis.

                            Today, physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is a very popular topic in the
                            field of ground manipulation. At the same time, Aerial Physical Interaction
                            (APhI) is also developing very fast. Nevertheless, pHRI with aerial vehicles
                            has not been addressed so far. In this work, we present the study of one of the
                            first systems in which a human is physically connected to an aerial vehicle by
                            a cable. We want the robot to be able to pull the human toward a desired
                            position (or along a path) only using forces as an indirect
                            communication-channel. We propose an admittance-based approach that makes pHRI
                            safe. A controller, inspired by the literature on flexible manipulators,
                            computes the desired interaction forces that properly guide the human. The
                            stability of the system is formally proved with a Lyapunov-based argument. The
                            system is also shown to be passive, and thus robust to non-idealities like
                            additional human forces, time-varying inputs, and other external disturbances.
                            We also design a maneuver regulation policy to simplify the path following
                            problem. The global method has been experimentally validated on a group of four
                            subjects, showing a reliable and safe pHRI.

                            This paper presents a new Statistical Forward Planning (SFP) method, Rolling
                            Horizon NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (rhNEAT). Unlike traditional
                            Rolling Horizon Evolution, where an evolutionary algorithm is in charge of
                            evolving a sequence of actions, rhNEAT evolves weights and connections of a
                            neural network in real-time, planning several steps ahead before returning an
                            action to execute in the game. Different versions of the algorithm are explored
                            in a collection of 20 GVGAI games, and compared with other SFP methods and
                            state of the art results. Although results are overall not better than other
                            SFP methods, the nature of rhNEAT to adapt to changing game features has
                            allowed to establish new state of the art records in games that other methods
                            have traditionally struggled with. The algorithm proposed here is general and
                            introduces a new way of representing information within rolling horizon
                            evolution techniques.

                            Due to the current developments towards autonomous driving and vehicle active
                            safety, there is an increasing necessity for algorithms that are able to
                            perform complex criticality predictions in real-time. Being able to process
                            multi-object traffic scenarios aids the implementation of a variety of
                            automotive applications such as driver assistance systems for collision
                            prevention and mitigation as well as fall-back systems for autonomous vehicles.
                            <br />We present a fully model-based algorithm with a parallelizable architecture.
                            The proposed algorithm can evaluate the criticality of complex, multi-modal
                            (vehicles and pedestrians) traffic scenarios by simulating millions of
                            trajectory combinations and detecting collisions between objects. The algorithm
                            is able to estimate upcoming criticality at very early stages, demonstrating
                            its potential for vehicle safety-systems and autonomous driving applications.
                            An implementation on an embedded system in a test vehicle proves in a
                            prototypical manner the compatibility of the algorithm with the hardware
                            possibilities of modern cars. For a complex traffic scenario with 11 dynamic
                            objects, more than 86 million pose combinations are evaluated in 21 ms on the
                            GPU of a Drive PX~2.

                            We investigate the practical aspects of computing the necessary and possible
                            winners in elections over incomplete voter preferences. In the case of the
                            necessary winners, we show how to implement and accelerate the polynomial-time
                            algorithm of Xia and Conitzer. In the case of the possible winners, where the
                            problem is NP-hard, we give a natural reduction to Integer Linear Programming
                            (ILP) for all positional scoring rules and implement it in a leading commercial
                            optimization solver. Further, we devise optimization techniques to minimize the
                            number of ILP executions and, oftentimes, avoid them altogether. We conduct a
                            thorough experimental study that includes the construction of a rich benchmark
                            of election data based on real and synthetic data. Our findings suggest that,
                            the worst-case intractability of the possible winners notwithstanding, the
                            algorithmic techniques presented here scale well and can be used to compute the
                            possible winners in realistic scenarios.

                            In this paper, the existing Scheduling Dimension Reduction (SDR) methods for
                            Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) models are reviewed and a Deep Neural Network
                            (DNN) approach is developed that achieves higher model accuracy under
                            scheduling dimension reduction. The proposed DNN method and existing SDR
                            methods are compared on a two-link robotic manipulator, both in terms of model
                            accuracy and performance of controllers synthesized with the reduced models.
                            The methods compared include SDR for state-space models using Principal
                            Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA) and Autoencoders (AE). On the
                            robotic manipulator example, the DNN method achieves improved representation of
                            the matrix variations of the original LPV model in terms of the Frobenius norm
                            compared to the current methods. Moreover, when the resulting model is used to
                            accommodate synthesis, improved closed-loop performance is obtained compared to
                            the current methods.

                            Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) enjoys several benefits, such as
                            data-efficiency and planning, by learning a model of the environment's
                            dynamics. However, learning a global model that can generalize across different
                            dynamics is a challenging task. To tackle this problem, we decompose the task
                            of learning a global dynamics model into two stages: (a) learning a context
                            latent vector that captures the local dynamics, then (b) predicting the next
                            state conditioned on it. In order to encode dynamics-specific information into
                            the context latent vector, we introduce a novel loss function that encourages
                            the context latent vector to be useful for predicting both forward and backward
                            dynamics. The proposed method achieves superior generalization ability across
                            various simulated robotics and control tasks, compared to existing RL schemes.

                            Temporal modeling is crucial for capturing spatiotemporal structure in videos
                            for action recognition. Video data is with extremely complex dynamics along
                            temporal dimension due to various factors such as camera motion, speed
                            variation, and different activities. To effectively capture this diverse motion
                            pattern, this paper presents a new temporal adaptive module (TAM) to generate
                            video-specific kernels based on its own feature maps. TAM proposes a unique
                            two-level adaptive modeling scheme by decoupling dynamic kernels into a
                            location insensitive importance map and a location invariant aggregation
                            weight. The importance map is learned in a local temporal window to capture
                            short term information, while the aggregation weight is generated from a global
                            view with a focus on long-term structure. TAM is a principled module and could
                            be integrated into 2D CNNs to yield a powerful video architecture (TANet) with
                            a very small extra computational cost. The extensive experiments on
                            Kinetics-400 demonstrate that TAM outperforms other temporal modeling methods
                            consistently owing to its adaptive modeling strategy. On Something-Something
                            datasets, TANet achieves superior performance compared with previous
                            state-of-the-art methods. The code will be made available soon at
                            https://github.com/liu-zhy/TANet.

                            Reversible computation opens up the possibility of overcoming some of the
                            hardware's current physical limitations. It also offers theoretical insights,
                            as it enriches multiple paradigms and models of computation, and sometimes
                            retrospectively enlightens them. Concurrent reversible computation, for
                            instance, offered interesting extensions to the Calculus of Communicating
                            Systems, but was still lacking a natural and pertinent bisimulation to study
                            processes equivalences. Our paper formulates an equivalence exploiting the two
                            aspects of reversibility: backward moves and memory mechanisms. This
                            bisimulation captures classical equivalences relations for denotational models

                            (H)HPB), that were up to now only partially characterized by process algebras.
                            This result gives an insight on the expressiveness of reversibility, as both
                            backward moves and a memory mechanism-providing 'backward determinism'-are
                            needed to capture HHPB.

                            The formalization of process algebras usually starts with a minimal core of
                            operators and rules for its transition system, and then relax the system to
                            improve its usability and ease the proofs. In the calculus of communicating
                            systems (CCS), the structural congruence plays this role by making e.g.
                            parallel composition commutative and associative: without it, the system would
                            be cumbersome to use and reason about, and it can be proven that this change is
                            innocuous in a precise technical sense. For the two reversible calculi
                            extending CCS, the situation is less clear: CCS with Communication Keys (CCSK)
                            was first defined without any structural congruence, and then was endowed with
                            a fragment of CCS's congruence. Reversible CCS (RCCS) made the choice of
                            "backing in" the structural equivalence, that became part of the "minimal core"
                            of the system. In this short oral communication, we would like to re-consider
                            the status and role of the structural congruence in general, to question its
                            role in RCCS in particular, and to ask the more general question of the
                            structural equivalences legitimacy.

                            Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automatically design deep neural
                            networks of satisfactory performance. Wherein, architecture performance
                            predictor is critical to efficiently value an intermediate neural architecture.
                            But for the training of this predictor, a number of neural architectures and
                            their corresponding real performance often have to be collected. In contrast
                            with classical performance predictor optimized in a fully supervised way, this
                            paper suggests a semi-supervised assessor of neural architectures. We employ an
                            auto-encoder to discover meaningful representations of neural architectures.
                            Taking each neural architecture as an individual instance in the search space,
                            we construct a graph to capture their intrinsic similarities, where both
                            labeled and unlabeled architectures are involved. A graph convolutional neural
                            network is introduced to predict the performance of architectures based on the
                            learned representations and their relation modeled by the graph. Extensive
                            experimental results on the NAS-Benchmark-101 dataset demonstrated that our
                            method is able to make a significant reduction on the required fully trained
                            architectures for finding efficient architectures.

                            Fractional repetition (FR) codes are a class of repair efficient erasure
                            codes that can recover a failed storage node with both optimal repair bandwidth
                            and complexity. In this paper, we study the minimum distance of FR codes, which
                            is the smallest number of nodes whose failure leads to the unrecoverable loss
                            of the stored file. We consider upper bounds on the minimum distance and
                            present several families of explicit FR codes attaining these bounds. The

                            So far, problems of intermittent fault (IF) detection and detectability have
                            not been fully investigated in the multivariate statistics framework. The
                            characteristics of IFs are small magnitudes and short durations, and
                            consequently traditional multivariate statistical methods using only a single
                            observation are no longer effective. Thus in this paper, moving average T^2
                            control charts (MA-TCCs) with multiple window lengths, which simultaneously
                            employ a bank of MA-TCCs with different window lengths, are proposed to address
                            the IF detection problem. Methods to reduce false/missing alarms and infer the
                            IFs' appearing and disappearing time instances are presented. In order to
                            analyze the detection capability for IFs, definitions of guaranteed
                            detectability are introduced, which is an extension and generalization of the
                            original fault detectability concept focused on permanent faults (PFs). Then,
                            necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the detectability of IFs,
                            which may appear and disappear several times with different magnitudes and
                            durations. Based on these conditions, some optimal properties of two important
                            window lengths are further discussed. In this way, a theoretical framework for
                            the analysis of IFs' detectability is established as well as extended
                            discussions on how the theoretical results can be adapted to real-world
                            applications. Finally, simulation studies on a numerical example and the
                            continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process are carried out to show the
                            effectiveness of the developed methods.

                            Software testing is sometimes plagued with intermittently failing tests and
                            finding the root causes of such failing tests is often difficult. This problem
                            has been widely studied at the unit testing level for open source software, but
                            there has been far less investigation at the system test level, particularly
                            the testing of industrial embedded systems. This paper describes our
                            investigation of the root causes of intermittently failing tests in the
                            embedded systems domain, with the goal of better understanding, explaining and
                            categorizing the underlying faults. The subject of our investigation is a
                            currently-running industrial embedded system, along with the system level
                            testing that was performed. We devised and used a novel metric for classifying
                            test cases as intermittent. From more than a half million test verdicts, we
                            identified intermittently and consistently failing tests, and identified their
                            root causes using multiple sources. We found that about 1-3% of all test cases
                            were intermittently failing. From analysis of the case study results and
                            related work, we identified nine factors associated with test case
                            intermittence. We found that a fix for a consistently failing test typically
                            removed a larger number of failures detected by other tests than a fix for an
                            intermittent test. We also found that more effort was usually needed to
                            identify fixes for intermittent tests than for consistent tests. An overlap
                            between root causes leading to intermittent and consistent tests was
                            identified. Many root causes of intermittence are the same in industrial
                            embedded systems and open source software. However, when comparing unit testing
                            to system level testing, especially for embedded systems, we observed that the
                            test environment itself is often the cause of intermittence.

                            We investigate the single source shortest distance (SSSD) and all pairs
                            shortest distance (APSD) problems as enumeration problems (on unweighted and
                            integer weighted graphs), meaning that the shortest distances are produced and
                            listed one by one without repetition. The performance is measured in the RAM
                            model of computation with respect to preprocessing time and delay, i.e., the
                            maximum time that elapses between two consecutive outputs. This point of view
                            reveals that specific types of output (e.g., excluding non-reachability
                            information, excluding the self-distances) and the order of enumeration (e.g.,
                            sorted by distance, row-wise w.r.t. the distance matrix) have a huge impact on
                            the complexity of APSD while they appear to have no effect on SSSD.
                            <br />In particular, we show for APSD that enumeration without output restrictions
                            is possible with delay in the order of the average degree. Excluding
                            non-reachability information, or requesting the output to be sorted by
                            distance, increases this delay to the order of the maximum degree. Further, for
                            weighted graphs, a delay in the order of the average degree is also not
                            possible without preprocessing or considering self-distances as output. In
                            contrast, for SSSD we find that a delay in the order of the maximum degree
                            without preprocessing is attainable and unavoidable for any of these
                            requirements.

                            To build light-weight network, we propose a new normalization, Fine-grained
                            Batch Normalization (FBN). Different from Batch Normalization (BN), which
                            normalizes the final summation of the weighted inputs, FBN normalizes the
                            intermediate state of the summation. We propose a novel light-weight network
                            based on FBN, called Finet. At training time, the convolutional layer with FBN
                            can be seen as an inverted bottleneck mechanism. FBN can be fused into
                            convolution at inference time. After fusion, Finet uses the standard
                            convolution with equal channel width, thus makes the inference more efficient.
                            On ImageNet classification dataset, Finet achieves the state-of-art performance
                            (65.706% accuracy with 43M FLOPs, and 73.786% accuracy with 303M FLOPs),
                            Moreover, experiments show that Finet is more efficient than other state-of-art
                            light-weight networks.

                            When deploying deep learning technology in self-driving cars, deep neural
                            networks are constantly exposed to domain shifts. These include, e.g., changes
                            in weather conditions, time of day, and long-term temporal shift. In this work
                            we utilize a deep neural network trained on the Cityscapes dataset containing

                            segments by means of the deep neural network's prediction and performs image
                            retrieval after feature extraction and dimensionality reduction on image
                            patches. In our experiments we demonstrate that the deployed OOD approach is
                            suitable for detecting out-of-distribution concepts. Furthermore, we evaluate
                            the image patch retrieval qualitatively as well as quantitatively by means of
                            the semi-compatible A2D2 ground truth and obtain mAP values of up to 52.2%.

                            The moving average (MA) technique, also known as the smoothing technique, has
                            been well established within the multivariate statistical process monitoring
                            (MSPM) framework since the 1990s. However, it is still limited to handling
                            independent data, and the optimality of its equal weight scheme remains
                            unproven. This paper aims to weaken the independence assumption in the existing
                            MA technique, and then extend it to a broader area of dealing with
                            autocorrelated stationary process, giving birth to a weighted moving average
                            (WMA) technique. The WMA technique is combined with the Hotelling's T^2
                            statistic to form a WMA T^2 control chart (WMA-TCC), in order to detect a more
                            challenging type of fault, i.e., intermittent fault (IF). Different from the MA
                            technique that puts an equal weight on samples within a time window, WMA-TCC
                            uses correlation (autocorrelation and cross-correlation) information to find an
                            optimal weight vector for the purpose of IF detection (IFD). In order to
                            achieve a best IFD performance, the concept of IF detectability is defined and
                            corresponding detectability conditions are provided, which further serve as
                            selection criteria of the optimal weight. Then, the optimal weight is given in
                            the form of a solution to nonlinear equations, whose existence is proven with
                            the aid of the Brouwer fixed-point theory. Moreover, symmetrical structure of
                            the optimal weight is revealed, and the optimality of an equal weight scheme
                            when data exhibit no autocorrelation is proven. Finally, simulations on a
                            numerical example and the continuous stirred tank reactor process are carried
                            out to give a comprehensive comparison among WMA-TCC and several existing
                            static and dynamic MSPM methods. The results show a superior IFD performance of
                            the developed methods.

                            In this study we investigated the repeatability and reproducibility of
                            radiomic features extracted from MRI images and provide a workflow to identify
                            robust features. 2D and 3D T$_2$-weighted images of a pelvic phantom were
                            acquired on three scanners of two manufacturers and two magnetic field
                            strengths. The repeatability and reproducibility of the radiomic features were
                            assessed respectively by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and
                            concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), considering repeated acquisitions
                            with or without phantom repositioning, and with different scanner/acquisition
                            type, and acquisition parameters. The features showing ICC/CCC &gt; 0.9 were
                            selected, and their dependence on shape information (Spearman's $\rho$&gt; 0.8)
                            was analyzed. They were classified for their ability to distinguish textures,
                            after shuffling voxel intensities. From 944 2D features, 79.9% to 96.4% showed
                            excellent repeatability in fixed position across all scanners. Much lower range
                            (11.2% to 85.4%) was obtained after phantom repositioning. 3D extraction did
                            not improve repeatability performance. Excellent reproducibility between
                            scanners was observed in 4.6% to 15.6% of the features, at fixed imaging
                            parameters. 82.4% to 94.9% of features showed excellent agreement when
                            extracted from images acquired with TEs 5 ms apart (values decreased when
                            increasing TE intervals) and 90.7% of the features exhibited excellent
                            reproducibility for changes in TR. 2.0% of non-shape features were identified
                            as providing only shape information. This study demonstrates that radiomic
                            features are affected by specific MRI protocols. The use of our radiomic pelvic
                            phantom allowed to identify unreliable features for radiomic analysis on
                            T$_2$-weighted images. This paper proposes a general workflow to identify
                            repeatable, reproducible, and informative radiomic features, fundamental to
                            ensure robustness of clinical studies.

                            Purpose: In 2009, US coupons set a new record of 367 billion coupons
                            distributed. Yet, while coupon distribution is on the rise, redemption rates
                            remain below 1 percent. This paper aims to show how recognizing context

                            The paper reports an empirical study conducted in co-operation with a
                            restaurant chain 9.880 Subway coupons were distributed under different
                            experimental context conditions. Redemption behavior was analyzed with the help
                            of logistic regressions. Findings: It was found that even though proximity
                            drives coupon redemption, city center campaigns seem to be much more sensitive
                            to distance than suburban areas. The further away the distribution place from
                            the restaurant, the less does the amount of monetary incentive determine the
                            motivation to redeem. Practical implications. When designing a coupon campaign
                            for a company, coupon distribution should not follow a -- one is good for all
                            strategy -- even for one marketer within one product category. Instead each
                            coupon strategy should carefully consider contextual influence.

                            The frequency with which people interact with technology means that users may
                            develop interface habits, i.e. fast, automatic responses to stable interface
                            cues. Design guidelines often assume that interface habits are beneficial.
                            However, we lack quantitative evidence of how the development of habits
                            actually affect user performance and an understanding of how changes in the
                            interface design may affect habit development. Our work quantifies the effect
                            of habit formation and disruption on user performance in interaction. Through a
                            forced choice lab study task (n=19) and in the wild deployment (n=18) of a
                            notificationdialog experiment on smartphones, we show that people become more
                            accurate and faster at option selection as they develop an interface habit.
                            Crucially this performance gain is entirely eliminated once the habit is
                            disrupted. We discuss reasons for this performance shift and analyse some
                            disadvantages of interface habits, outlining general design patterns on how to
                            both support and disrupt them.Keywords: Interface habits, user behaviour,
                            breaking habit, interaction science, quantitative research.

                            Federated Learning (FL) is a very promising approach for improving
                            decentralized Machine Learning (ML) models by exchanging knowledge between
                            participating clients without revealing private data. Nevertheless, FL is still
                            not tailored to the industrial context as strong data similarity is assumed for
                            all FL tasks. This is rarely the case in industrial machine data with
                            variations in machine type, operational- and environmental conditions.
                            Therefore, we introduce an Industrial Federated Learning (IFL) system
                            supporting knowledge exchange in continuously evaluated and updated FL cohorts
                            of learning tasks with sufficient data similarity. This enables optimal
                            collaboration of business partners in common ML problems, prevents negative
                            knowledge transfer, and ensures resource optimization of involved edge devices.

                            Machine learning is being integrated into a growing number of critical
                            systems with far-reaching impacts on society. Unexpected behaviour and unfair
                            decision processes are coming under increasing scrutiny due to this widespread
                            use and also due to theoretical considerations. Individuals, as well as
                            organisations, notice, test, and criticize unfair results to hold model
                            designers and deployers accountable. This requires transparency and the
                            possibility to describe, measure and, ideally, prove the 'fairness' of a
                            system. This involves concepts such as fairness, transparency and
                            accountability that will hopefully make machine learning more amenable to
                            criticism and improvement proposals towards the fulfilment of societal goals.
                            We concentrate on fairness, taking into account that both the transparency of
                            the neural networks and accountability of actors and systems will require
                            further methods. We offer a new framework that assists in mitigating unfair
                            representations in the dataset used for training. Our framework relies on
                            adversaries to improve fairness. First, it evaluates a model for unfairness
                            w.r.t. protected attributes and ensures that an adversary cannot guess such
                            attributes for a given outcome, by optimizing the model's parameters for
                            fairness while limiting utility losses. Second, the framework leverages evasion
                            attacks from adversarial machine learning to perform adversarial retraining
                            with new examples unseen by the model. These two steps are iteratively applied
                            until a significant improvement in fairness is obtained. We evaluated our
                            framework on well-studied datasets in the fairness literature-including
                            COMPAS-where it can surpass other approaches concerning demographic parity,
                            equality of opportunity and also the model's utility. We also illustrate our
                            findings on the subtle difficulties when mitigating unfairness and highlight
                            how our framework can help model designers.

                            We study the Darcy boundary value problem with log-normal permeability field.
                            We adopt a perturbation approach, expanding the solution in Taylor series
                            around the nominal value of the coefficient, and approximating the expected
                            value of the stochastic solution of the PDE by the expected value of its Taylor

                            Well-posedness and regularity results for the recursion are proved to hold in

                            We present a novel network pruning algorithm called Dynamic Sparse Training
                            that can jointly find the optimal network parameters and sparse network
                            structure in a unified optimization process with trainable pruning thresholds.
                            These thresholds can have fine-grained layer-wise adjustments dynamically via
                            backpropagation. We demonstrate that our dynamic sparse training algorithm can
                            easily train very sparse neural network models with little performance loss
                            using the same number of training epochs as dense models. Dynamic Sparse
                            Training achieves the state of the art performance compared with other sparse
                            training algorithms on various network architectures. Additionally, we have

                            In this article, we propose a Category Theory approach to (syntactic)
                            interoperability between linguistic tools. The resulting category consists of
                            textual documents, including any linguistic annotations, NLP tools that analyze
                            texts and add additional linguistic information, and format converters. Format
                            converters are necessary to make the tools both able to read and to produce
                            different output formats, which is the key to interoperability. The idea behind
                            this document is the parallelism between the concepts of composition and
                            associativity in Category Theory with the NLP pipelines. We show how pipelines
                            of linguistic tools can be modeled into the conceptual framework of Category
                            Theory and we successfully apply this method to two real-life examples.

                            This contribution investigates how cross-platform development frameworks
                            (CPDF) support the creation of mobile applications that are accessible to
                            people with visual impairments through screen readers. We first systematically
                            analyze screen-reader APIs available in native iOS and Android, and we examine
                            whether and at what level the same functionalities are available in two popular
                            CPDF: Xamarin and React Native. This analysis unveils that there are many
                            functionalities shared between native iOS and Android APIs, but most of them
                            are not available in React Native or Xamarin. In particular, not even all basic
                            APIs are exposed by the examined CPDF.
                            <br />Accessing the unavailable APIs is still possible, but it requires an
                            additional effort by the developers who need to know native APIs and to write
                            platform specific code, hence partially negating the advantages of CPDF. To
                            address this problem, we consider a representative set of native APIs that
                            cannot be directly accessed from React Native and Xamarin and show sample
                            implementations for accessing them.

                            We present a self-learning approach that combines deep reinforcement learning
                            and Monte Carlo tree search to solve the traveling salesman problem. The
                            proposed approach has two advantages. First, it adopts deep reinforcement
                            learning to compute the value functions for decision, which removes the need of
                            hand-crafted features and labelled data. Second, it uses Monte Carlo tree
                            search to select the best policy by comparing different value functions, which
                            increases its generalization ability. Experimental results show that the
                            proposed method performs favorably against other methods in small-to-medium
                            problem settings. And it shows comparable performance as state-of-the-art in

                            Incremental and parallel builds are crucial features of modern build systems.
                            Parallelism enables fast builds by running independent tasks simultaneously,
                            while incrementality saves time and computing resources by processing the build
                            operations that were affected by a particular code change. Writing build
                            definitions that lead to error-free incremental and parallel builds is a
                            challenging task. This is mainly because developers are often unable to predict
                            the effects of build operations on the file system and how different build
                            operations interact with each other. Faulty build scripts may seriously degrade
                            the reliability of automated builds, as they cause build failures, and
                            non-deterministic and incorrect build results.
                            <br />To reason about arbitrary build executions, we present buildfs, a
                            generally-applicable model that takes into account the specification (as
                            declared in build scripts) and the actual behavior (low-level file system
                            operation) of build operations. We then formally define different types of
                            faults related to incremental and parallel builds in terms of the conditions
                            under which a file system operation violates the specification of a build
                            operation. Our testing approach, which relies on the proposed model, analyzes
                            the execution of single full build, translates it into buildfs, and uncovers
                            faults by checking for corresponding violations.
                            <br />We evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of our approach
                            by examining hundreds of Make and Gradle projects. Notably, our method is the
                            first to handle Java-oriented build systems. The results indicate that our
                            approach is (1) able to uncover several important issues (245 issues found in
                            45 open-source projects have been confirmed and fixed by the upstream
                            developers), and (2) orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art tool
                            for Make builds.

                            We propose a novel activity learning framework based on Edge Cloud
                            architecture for the purpose of recognizing and predicting human activities.
                            Although activity recognition has been vastly studied by many researchers, the
                            temporal features that constitute an activity, which can provide useful
                            insights for activity models, have not been exploited to their full potentials
                            by mining algorithms. In this paper, we utilize temporal features for activity
                            recognition and prediction in a single smart home setting. We discover activity
                            patterns and temporal relations such as the order of activities from real data
                            to develop a prompting system. Analysis of real data collected from smart homes
                            was used to validate the proposed method.

                            Models of the consensus of the individual state in social systems have been
                            the subject of recent researches in the physics literature. We investigate how
                            network structures coevolve with the individual state under the framework of
                            social identity theory. And we propose an adaptive network model to achieve
                            state consensus or local structural adjustment of individuals by evaluating the
                            homogeneity among them. Specifically, the similarity threshold significantly
                            affects the evolution of the network with different initial conditions, and
                            thus there emerges obvious community structure and polarization. More
                            importantly, there exists a critical point of phase transition, at which the
                            network may evolve into a significant community structure and state-consistent
                            group.

                            In this work, we develop a discretisation method for the mixed formulation of
                            the magnetostatic problem supporting arbitrary orders and polyhedral meshes.
                            The method is based on a global discrete de Rham (DDR) sequence, obtained
                            patching the local spaces constructed in [Di Pietro, Droniou, Rapetti, Fully
                            discrete polynomial de Rham sequences of arbitrary degree on polygons and
                            polyhedra, <a href="/abs/1911.03616">arXiv:1911.03616</a>] by enforcing the single-valuedness of the
                            components attached to the boundary of each element. The first main
                            contribution of this paper is a proof of exactness relations for this global
                            DDR sequence, obtained leveraging the exactness of the corresponding local
                            sequence and a topological assembly of the mesh valid for domains that do not
                            enclose any void. The second main contribution is the formulation and
                            well-posedness analysis of the method, which includes the proof of uniform
                            Poincar\'e inequalities for the discrete divergence and curl operators. The
                            convergence rate in the natural energy norm is numerically evaluated on
                            standard and polyhedral meshes. When the DDR sequence of degree $k\ge 0$ is
                            used, the error converges as $h^{k+1}$, with $h$ denoting the meshsize.

                            Image Understanding is becoming a vital feature in ever more applications
                            ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous vehicles. Many applications
                            demand for embedded solutions that integrate into existing systems with tight
                            real-time and power constraints. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presently
                            achieve record-breaking accuracies in all image understanding benchmarks, but
                            have a very high computational complexity. Embedded CNNs thus call for small
                            and efficient, yet very powerful computing platforms. This master thesis
                            explores the potential of FPGA-based CNN acceleration and demonstrates a fully
                            functional proof-of-concept CNN implementation on a Zynq System-on-Chip. The
                            ZynqNet Embedded CNN is designed for image classification on ImageNet and
                            consists of ZynqNet CNN, an optimized and customized CNN topology, and the
                            ZynqNet FPGA Accelerator, an FPGA-based architecture for its evaluation.
                            ZynqNet CNN is a highly efficient CNN topology. Detailed analysis and
                            optimization of prior topologies using the custom-designed Netscope CNN
                            Analyzer have enabled a CNN with 84.5% top-5 accuracy at a computational
                            complexity of only 530 million multiplyaccumulate operations. The topology is
                            highly regular and consists exclusively of convolutional layers, ReLU
                            nonlinearities and one global pooling layer. The CNN fits ideally onto the FPGA
                            accelerator. The ZynqNet FPGA Accelerator allows an efficient evaluation of
                            ZynqNet CNN. It accelerates the full network based on a nested-loop algorithm
                            which minimizes the number of arithmetic operations and memory accesses. The
                            FPGA accelerator has been synthesized using High-Level Synthesis for the Xilinx
                            Zynq XC-7Z045, and reaches a clock frequency of 200MHz with a device
                            utilization of 80% to 90 %.

                            We propose a novel framework that detects conflicts in IoT-based smart homes.

                            Inertial measurement units are commonly used to estimate the attitude of
                            moving objects. Numerous nonlinear filter approaches have been proposed for
                            solving the inherent sensor fusion problem. However, when a large range of
                            different dynamic and static rotational and translational motions is
                            considered, the attainable accuracy is limited by the need for
                            situation-dependent adjustment of accelerometer and gyroscope fusion weights.
                            We investigate to which extent these limitations can be overcome by means of
                            artificial neural networks and how much domainspecific optimization of the
                            neural network model is required to outperform the conventional filter
                            solution. A diverse set of motion recordings with a marker-based optical ground
                            truth is used for performance evaluation and comparison. The proposed neural
                            networks are found to outperform the conventional filter across all motions
                            only if domain-specific optimizations are introduced. We conclude that they are
                            a promising tool for inertial-sensor-based real-time attitude estimation, but
                            both expert knowledge and rich data sets are required to achieve top
                            performance.

                            learning, and performing more rigorous analysis of training data. Mitigating
                            bias when algorithms are trainedon textual data is particularly challenging
                            given the complex way gender ideology is embedded in language. This paper
                            proposes a framework for the identification of gender bias in training data for
                            machine learning.The work draws upon gender theory and sociolinguistics to
                            systematically indicate levels of bias in textual training data and associated
                            neural word embedding models, thus highlighting pathways for both removing bias
                            from training data and critically assessing its impact in the context of search
                            and recommender systems.

                            We consider a problem of unsourced random access in the quasi-static Rayleigh
                            fading channel. In the previous work, the authors have proposed LDPC code based
                            solutions based on joint and treat interference as noise in combination with
                            successive interference cancellation (TIN-SIC) decoder architectures. The
                            authors showed that TIN-SIC decoding significantly outperforms the joint
                            decoding approach and much simpler from the implementation point of view. In
                            this paper, we continue the analysis of TIN-SIC decoding. We derive a finite
                            length achievability bound for TIN-SIC decoder using random coding and propose
                            a practical polar code based TIN-SIC scheme. The latter's performance becomes
                            significantly better in comparison to LDPC code based solutions and close to

                            Discourse representation tree structure (DRTS) parsing is a novel semantic
                            parsing task which has been concerned most recently. State-of-the-art
                            performance can be achieved by a neural sequence-to-sequence model, treating
                            the tree construction as an incremental sequence generation problem. Structural
                            information such as input syntax and the intermediate skeleton of the partial
                            output has been ignored in the model, which could be potentially useful for the
                            DRTS parsing. In this work, we propose a structural-aware model at both the
                            encoder and decoder phase to integrate the structural information, where graph
                            attention network (GAT) is exploited for effectively modeling. Experimental
                            results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed model is effective and
                            can obtain the best performance in the literature.

                            Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is an important graph algorithm that has wide
                            ranging applications in the areas of computer networks, VLSI routing, wireless
                            communications among others. Today virtually every computer is built out of
                            multi-core processors. Hence it is important to take advantage of such parallel
                            computing power by parallelizing existing algorithms and applications. Most of
                            the earlier work on parallelizing MST focused on algorithms for PRAM models.
                            There are two limitations to such studies. First, PRAM models assume infinite
                            memory bandwidth which is unrealistic. Second, PRAM model based algorithms
                            require at least O(n) processors where n being total number of vertices. For
                            large graphs this is infeasible. There are very few implementations which
                            target real systems. In this paper I present and evaluate two new parallel MST
                            algorithms that are a variant of Parallel Boruvka algorithms: i) First
                            algorithm uses lock variables without spin-locks ii) Second algorithm uses only
                            atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) primitive. I evaluated the performance of these
                            algorithms on a six-core, 12-thread Intel system on various input graphs of
                            sizes up to 1 million vertices. First algorithm showed a speedup of up to1.94
                            over an un-optimized sequential algorithm and a speedup of up to 1.4 over an
                            optimized sequential algorithm. Second algorithm showed a speedup of up to 2.03
                            over an un-optimized sequential algorithm and a speedup of up to 1.403 over an
                            optimized sequential algorithm. When second algorithm using CAS is compared
                            with the first algorithm second algorithm is found to be up to 1.15 times
                            better than the first algorithm at four threads.

                            with cognitive capabilities for the purpose of improving life convenience.
                            Specifically, the Cognitive Amplifier consists of knowledge discovery and
                            prediction components. The knowledge discovery component focuses on finding
                            natural activity patterns considering their regularity, variations, and
                            transitions in real life setting. The prediction component takes the discovered
                            knowledge as the base for inferring what, when, and where the next activity
                            will happen. Experimental results on real-life data validate the feasibility

                            Truthfulness judgments are a fundamental step in the process of fighting
                            misinformation, as they are crucial to train and evaluate classifiers that
                            automatically distinguish true and false statements. Usually such judgments are
                            made by experts, like journalists for political statements or medical doctors
                            for medical statements. In this paper, we follow a different approach and rely
                            on (non-expert) crowd workers. This of course leads to the following research
                            question: Can crowdsourcing be reliably used to assess the truthfulness of
                            information and to create large-scale labeled collections for information
                            credibility systems? To address this issue, we present the results of an
                            extensive study based on crowdsourcing: we collect thousands of truthfulness
                            assessments over two datasets, and we compare expert judgments with crowd
                            judgments, expressed on scales with various granularity levels. We also measure
                            the political bias and the cognitive background of the workers, and quantify
                            their effect on the reliability of the data provided by the crowd.

                            The heterogeneity of data poses a great challenge when data from different
                            sources is to be merged for one application. Solutions for this are offered,
                            for example, by ontology-based data management (OBDM). A challenge of OBDM is
                            the automatic creation of semantic models from datasets. This process is
                            typically performed either data- or label-driven and always involves manual
                            human intervention. We identified textual descriptions of data, a form of
                            metadata, quickly to be produced and consumed by humans, as third possible
                            basis for automatic semantic modelling. In this paper, we present, how we plan
                            to use textual descriptions to enhance semantic data management. We will use
                            state of the art NLP technologies to identify concepts within textual
                            descriptions and build semantic models from this in combination with an
                            evolving ontology. We will use automatically identified models in combination
                            with the human data provider to automatically extend the ontology so that it
                            learns new verified concepts over time. Finally, we will use the created
                            ontology and automatically identified semantic models to either rate
                            descriptions for new data sources or even to automatically generate descriptive
                            texts that are easier to understand by the human user than formal models. We
                            present the procedure which we plan for the ongoing research, as well as
                            expected outcomes.

                            In this paper, we first provide analytical expressions for the block erasure
                            probability (BEP) of block codes that can recover erasures that are (1) random
                            with weight atmost $a$ or (2) burst with atmost $b$ consecutive erasures when
                            used over Gilbert-Elliott (GE) channel. The same approach is then used to come
                            up with tractable upper and lower bounds for the BEP over the GE channel, of
                            codes designed for the delay constrained sliding window (DCSW) channel model
                            introduced by Badr et al. This channel model permits either a single burst of
                            $b$ erasures or else $a$ random erasures within a sliding window of specified
                            length and requires recovery within a strict decoding delay constraint. Using
                            the upper bound for BEP, we show that the family of streaming codes developed
                            for the DCSW channel offer better rates in comparison with MDS codes operating
                            under the same conditions of delay and BEP.

                            Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science
                            with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting
                            in progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense
                            algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of
                            the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning,
                            we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional
                            synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem,
                            relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances
                            in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable
                            verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we
                            demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the
                            art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a
                            state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76
                            benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60
                            benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve.
                            The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis,
                            highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of
                            machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.

                            Due to significant improvements in performance in recent years, neural
                            networks are currently used for an ever-increasing number of applications.
                            However, neural networks have the drawback that their decisions are not readily
                            interpretable and traceable for a human. This creates several problems, for
                            instance in terms of safety and IT security for high-risk applications, where
                            assuring these properties is crucial. One of the most striking IT security
                            problems aggravated by the opacity of neural networks is the possibility of
                            so-called poisoning attacks during the training phase, where an attacker
                            inserts specially crafted data to manipulate the resulting model. We propose an
                            approach to this problem which allows provably verifying the integrity of the
                            training procedure by making use of standard cryptographic mechanisms.

                            Large-scale population-based studies in medicine are a key resource towards
                            better diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases. They also serve as
                            enablers of clinical decision support systems, in particular Computer Aided
                            Diagnosis (CADx) using machine learning (ML). Numerous ML approaches for CADx
                            have been proposed in literature. However, these approaches assume full data
                            availability, which is not always feasible in clinical data. To account for
                            missing data, incomplete data samples are either removed or imputed, which
                            could lead to data bias and may negatively affect classification performance.
                            As a solution, we propose an end-to-end learning of imputation and disease
                            prediction of incomplete medical datasets via Multigraph Geometric Matrix
                            Completion (MGMC). MGMC uses multiple recurrent graph convolutional networks,
                            where each graph represents an independent population model based on a key
                            clinical meta-feature like age, sex, or cognitive function. Graph signal
                            aggregation from local patient neighborhoods, combined with multigraph signal
                            fusion via self-attention, has a regularizing effect on both matrix
                            reconstruction and classification performance. Our proposed approach is able to
                            impute class relevant features as well as perform accurate classification on
                            two publicly available medical datasets. We empirically show the superiority of
                            our proposed approach in terms of classification and imputation performance
                            when compared with state-of-the-art approaches. MGMC enables disease prediction
                            in multimodal and incomplete medical datasets. These findings could serve as
                            baseline for future CADx approaches which utilize incomplete datasets.

                            The paper describes the systems submitted to SemEval-2020 Task 8: Memotion by
                            the `NIT-Agartala-NLP-Team'. A dataset of 8879 memes was made available by the
                            task organizers to train and test our models. Our systems include a Logistic
                            Regression baseline, a BiLSTM + Attention-based learner and a transfer learning
                            approach with BERT. For the three sub-tasks A, B and C, we attained ranks 26,
                            11 and 16, respectively. We highlight our difficulties in harnessing image
                            information as well as some techniques and handcrafted features we employ to
                            overcome these issues. We also discuss various modelling issues and theorize
                            possible solutions and reasons as to why these problems persist.

                            360$^\circ$ video is a novel media format, rapidly becoming adopted in media

                            revolution. Due to its novelty, there is a lack of tools for producing highly

                            With the increasing popularity of mobile devices and the wide adoption of
                            mobile Apps, an increasing concern of privacy issues is raised. Privacy policy
                            is identified as a proper medium to indicate the legal terms, such as GDPR, and
                            to bind legal agreement between service providers and users. However, privacy
                            policies are usually long and vague for end users to read and understand. It is
                            thus important to be able to automatically analyze the document structures of
                            privacy policies to assist user understanding. In this work we create a
                            manually labelled corpus containing $167$ privacy policies (of more than $447$K
                            words and $5,276$ annotated paragraphs). We report the annotation process and
                            details of the annotated corpus. We also benchmark our data corpus with $4$
                            document classification models, thoroughly analyze the results and discuss
                            challenges and opportunities for the research committee to use the corpus. We
                            release our labelled corpus as well as the classification models for public
                            access.

                            A Maximum Distance Separable code over an alphabet $F$ is defined via an
                            encoding function $C:F^k \rightarrow F^n$ that allows to retrieve a message $m
                            \in F^k$ from the codeword $C(m)$ even after erasing any $n-k$ of its symbols.
                            The minimum possible alphabet size of general (non-linear) MDS codes for given
                            parameters $n$ and $k$ is unknown and forms one of the central open problems in
                            coding theory. The paper initiates the study of the alphabet size of codes in a
                            generalized setting where the coding scheme is required to handle a
                            pre-specified subset of all possible erasure patterns, naturally represented by
                            an $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph. We relate the minimum possible alphabet
                            size of such codes to the strong chromatic number of the hypergraph and analyze
                            the tightness of the obtained bounds for both the linear and non-linear
                            settings. We further consider variations of the problem which allow a small
                            probability of decoding error.

                            We propose a novel framework for composing Swarm-based Drone-as-a-Service
                            (SDaaS) for delivery. Two composition approaches, i.e., sequential and parallel
                            are designed considering the different behaviors of drone swarms. The proposed
                            framework considers various constraints, e.g., recharging time and limited
                            battery to meet delivery deadlines. We propose SDaaS composition algorithms
                            using a modified A* algorithm. A cooperative behavior model is incorporated to
                            reduce recharging and waiting time in a delivery. Experimental results prove
                            the efficiency of the proposed approach.

                            Computer networks covered the entire world and a serious and new development
                            has not formed for many years. But companies and consumer organizations
                            complain about the failure to add new features to their networks and according
                            to their need, like much of the works to be done automatically and they also
                            like to develop and expand their networks on the software side so they do not
                            need new expensive hardware for many of the activities and needs of their
                            network. Analysis of the control layers and writing data in Software-Defined
                            Network facilitate network management and accelerate innovation in network. In
                            order to develop broad networks of SDN, often a large number controller is
                            needed and located position of controllers in the SDN networks and can be
                            raised as an important and basic issue in the field of SDN network and have
                            impact on reliability of SDN networks. This paper focused on latency and
                            reliability in SDN networks. The latency here means the delay in response to
                            the request of data path that has a significant impact on network latency. In
                            this paper it is shown that the number of controllers and their position can be
                            effective on two measures; reliability and latency in SDN networks.

                            Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services are attracting a lot of attention in the
                            research and industry communities due to their applicability in the landscape
                            of connected and autonomous vehicles. Such applications have stringent
                            performance requirements in terms of complex data processing and low latency
                            communications which are utilized to ensure road safety and improve road
                            conditions. To address these challenges, the placement of V2X applications
                            through leveraging of edge computing paradigm, that distributes the computing
                            capabilities to access points in proximity to the vehicles, presents itself as
                            a viable solution. However, the realistic implementation of the edge enabled
                            V2X applications is hindered by the limited computational power provided at the
                            edge and the nature of V2X applications that are composed of multiple
                            independent V2X basic services. To address these challenges, this work targets
                            the efficient placement of V2X basic services in a highway scenario subject to
                            the delay constraints of V2X applications using them and the limited
                            computational resources at the edge. To that end, this work formulates a binary
                            integer linear programming model that minimizes the delay of V2X applications
                            while satisfying the resource requirements of V2X basic services. To
                            demonstrate the soundness of the approach, simulations with varying vehicle
                            densities were conducted, and the results reported show that it can satisfy the
                            delay requirements of V2X applications.

                            In this age of heterogeneous systems, diverse technologies are integrated to
                            create application-specific solutions. The recent upsurge in acceptance of
                            technologies such as cloud computing and ubiquitous Internet has cleared the
                            path for Internet of Things (IoT). Moreover, the increasing Internet
                            penetration with the rising use of mobile devices has inspired an era of
                            technology that allows interfacing of physical objects and connecting them to
                            Internet for developing applications serving a wide range of purposes. Recent
                            developments in the area of wearable devices has led to the creation of another
                            segment in IoT, which can be conveniently referred to as Wearable Internet of

                            health information. This chapter shall cover the different facets of Wearable
                            Internet of Things (WIoT) and ways in which it is a key driving technology
                            behind the concept of personalized healthcare. It shall discuss the theoretical
                            aspects of WIoT, focusing on functionality, design and applicability. Moreover,

                            depending on the underlying architecture and design methodology. The article
                            surveys on the various kinds of MDS architecture, designs, and methodologies.
                            This article emphasizes on clustered MDS (cMDS) and the reports are prepared
                            based on a) Bloom filter$-$based MDS, b) Client$-$funded MDS, c) Geo$-$aware
                            MDS, d) Cache$-$aware MDS, e) Load$-$aware MDS, f) Hash$-$based MDS, and g)
                            Tree$-$based MDS. Additionally, the article presents the issues and challenges
                            of MDS for mammoth sized data.

                            This paper presents the overview of the current trends of Big data against
                            the computing scenario from different aspects. Some of the important aspect
                            includes the Exascale, the computing power and the kind of applications which
                            offer the Big data. This starts with the current computing hardware constraint
                            against the need of the rising Big data applications. We highlight the issues
                            and challenges of energy requirement, software complexity, hardware failure,
                            fault tolerant computing, and communication. As the complexity of computation
                            is going to rise in the future. The paper also highlights the future direction
                            of Big computing systems for Bioinformatics, social media, hardware and
                            software requirements, data intensive computation and then towards GPU era.

                            Today is the era of smart devices. Through the smart devices, people remain
                            connected with systems across the globe even in mobile state. Hence, the
                            current Internet is facing scalability issue. Therefore, leaving IP based
                            Internet behind due to scalability, the world is moving to the Future Internet
                            Architecture, called Named Data Networking (NDN). Currently, the number of
                            nodes connected to the Internet is in billions. And, the number of requests
                            sent is in millions per second. NDN handles such huge numbers by modifying the
                            IP architecture to meet the current requirements. NDN is scalable, produces
                            less traffic and congestion, provides high level security, saves bandwidth,
                            efficiently utilizes multiple network interfaces and have many more
                            functionalities. Similarly, Bloom Filter is the only good choice to deploy in
                            various modules of NDN to handle the huge number of packets. Bloom Filter is a
                            simple probabilistic data structure for the membership query. This article
                            presents a detailed discussion on the role of Bloom Filter in implementing NDN.
                            The article includes a precise discussion on Bloom Filter and the main
                            components of the NDN architecture, namely, packet, content store, forward
                            information base and pending interest table are also discussed briefly.

                            Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a class of single-layer recurrent neural
                            networks with randomly generated internal weights, and a single layer of
                            tuneable outer weights, which are usually trained by regularised linear least
                            squares regression. Remarkably, ESNs still enjoy the universal approximation
                            property despite the training procedure being entirely linear. In this paper,
                            we prove that an ESN trained on a sequence of scalar observations from an
                            ergodic dynamical system (with invariant measure {\mu}) using Tikhonov least
                            squares will approximate future observations of the dynamical system in the
                            L2({\mu}) norm. We call this the ESN Training Theorem. We demonstrate the
                            theory numerically by training an ESN using Tikhonov least squares on a
                            sequence of scalar observations of the Lorenz system, and compare the invariant
                            measure of these observations with the invariant measure of the future
                            predictions of the autonomous ESN.

                            An estimated half of the world's languages do not have a written form, making
                            it impossible for these languages to benefit from any existing text-based
                            technologies. In this paper, a speech-to-image generation (S2IG) framework is
                            proposed which translates speech descriptions to photo-realistic images without
                            using any text information, thus allowing unwritten languages to potentially
                            benefit from this technology. The proposed S2IG framework, named S2IGAN,
                            consists of a speech embedding network (SEN) and a relation-supervised
                            densely-stacked generative model (RDG). SEN learns the speech embedding with
                            the supervision of the corresponding visual information. Conditioned on the
                            speech embedding produced by SEN, the proposed RDG synthesizes images that are
                            semantically consistent with the corresponding speech descriptions. Extensive
                            experiments on two public benchmark datasets CUB and Oxford-102 demonstrate the
                            effectiveness of the proposed S2IGAN on synthesizing high-quality and
                            semantically-consistent images from the speech signal, yielding a good
                            performance and a solid baseline for the S2IG task.

                            Large-scale optimization problems arising from the discretization of problems
                            involving PDEs sometimes admit solutions that can be well approximated by
                            low-rank matrices. In this paper, we will exploit this low-rank approximation
                            property by solving the optimization problem directly over the set of low-rank
                            matrices. In particular, we introduce a new multilevel algorithm, where the
                            optimization variable is constrained to the Riemannian manifold of fixed-rank
                            matrices. In contrast to most other multilevel low-rank algorithms where the
                            rank is chosen adaptively on each level, we can keep the ranks (and thus the
                            computational complexity) fixed throughout the iterations. Furthermore,
                            classical implementations of line searches based on Wolfe conditions allow
                            computing a solution where the numerical accuracy is limited to about the
                            square root of the machine epsilon. Here, we propose an extension to Riemannian

                            Data-driven methods -- such as machine learning and time series forecasting
                            -- are widely used for sales forecasting in the food retail domain. However,
                            for newly introduced products insufficient training data is available to train
                            accurate models. In this case, human expert systems are implemented to improve
                            prediction performance. Human experts rely on their implicit and explicit
                            domain knowledge and transfer knowledge about historical sales of similar
                            products to forecast new product sales. By applying the concept of Transfer
                            Learning, we propose an analytical approach to transfer knowledge between
                            listed stock products and new products. A network-based Transfer Learning
                            approach for deep neural networks is designed to investigate the efficiency of
                            Transfer Learning in the domain of food sales forecasting. Furthermore, we
                            examine how knowledge can be shared across different products and how to
                            identify the products most suitable for transfer. To test the proposed
                            approach, we conduct a comprehensive case study for a newly introduced product,
                            based on data of an Austrian food retailing company. The experimental results
                            show, that the prediction accuracy of deep neural networks for food sales
                            forecasting can be effectively increased using the proposed approach.

                            The ability to match pieces of code to their corresponding natural language
                            descriptions and vice versa is fundamental for natural language search
                            interfaces to software repositories. In this paper, we propose a novel

                            inspired in part by a previous model for monolingual text-to-text matching, to
                            capture both global and local similarities. Our experiments on the CoNaLa
                            dataset show that our proposed model yields better performance on this

                            The propagation of failures and blackouts in electric networks is a complex
                            problem. Typical models, such as the ORNL-PSerc-Alaska (OPA), are based on a
                            combination of fast and a slow dynamics. The first describes the cascading
                            failures while the second the grid evolution though line and generation
                            upgrades as well as demand growth, all taking place in time scales from days to
                            years. The growing integration of renewable energy sources, whose power
                            fluctuates in time scales from seconds to hours, together with the increase in
                            demand, which also present fast fluctuations, require the incorporation of
                            distributed methods of control in the demand side to avoid the high cost of
                            ordinary control in conventional power plants. In this work, we extend the OPA
                            model to include fluctuations in the demand at time scales of the order of
                            minutes, intraday demand variations and the effect of demand control. We find
                            that demand control effectively reduces the number of blackouts without
                            increasing the probability of large-scale events.

                            Existing power cyber-physical system (CPS) risk prediction results are
                            inaccurate as they fail to reflect the actual physical characteristics of the
                            components and the specific operational status. A new method based on dependent
                            Markov chain for power CPS risk area prediction is proposed in this paper. The
                            load and constraints of the non-uniform power CPS coupling network are first
                            characterized, and can be utilized as a node state judgment standard.
                            Considering the component node isomerism and interdependence between the
                            coupled networks, a power CPS risk regional prediction model based on dependent
                            Markov chain is then constructed. A cross-adaptive gray wolf optimization
                            algorithm improved by adaptive position adjustment strategy and cross-optimal
                            solution strategy is subsequently developed to optimize the prediction model.
                            Simulation results using the IEEE 39-BA 110 test system verify the
                            effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

                            A recent study of skipping behaviour on music streaming platforms has shown
                            that the skip profile for a given song -- i.e. the measure of the skipping rate
                            as a function of the time in the song -- can be seen as some intrinsic
                            characteristic of the song, in the sense that it is both very specific and
                            highly stable over time and geographical regions. In this paper, we take this
                            analysis one step further by introducing a simple model of skip behaviours, in
                            which the skip profile for a given song is viewed as the response to a small
                            number of events that happen within it. In particular, it allows us to identify
                            accurately the timing of the events that trigger skip responses, as well as the
                            fraction of users who skip following each these events. Strikingly, the
                            responses triggered by individual events appears to follow a temporal profile
                            that is consistent across songs, genres, devices and listening contexts,
                            suggesting that people react to musical surprises in a universal way.

                            The ATLAS Collaboration defines methods, establishes procedures, and
                            organises advisory groups to manage the publication processes of scientific
                            papers, conference papers, and public notes. All stages are managed through web
                            systems, computing programs, and tools that are designed and developed by the
                            Collaboration. The Phase 0 system was implemented using the FENCE framework and
                            is integrated into the CERN GitLab software repository, to automatically
                            configure workspaces where the analysis can be documented and used by the
                            analysis team and managed by the conveners. Continuous integration is used to
                            guide the writers in applying accurate format and valid statements when
                            preparing papers to be submitted to scientific journals. Additional software
                            assures the correctness of other aspects such as lists of collaboration
                            authors, funding agencies, and foundations. The ATLAS Physics and Committees
                            Office provides support to the researchers and facilitates each phase of the
                            publication process, allowing authors to focus on the article's contents that
                            describe the results of the ATLAS experiment.

                            Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws are a class of security flaws that permit
                            the injection of malicious code into a web application. In simple situations,
                            these flaws can be caused by missing input sanitizations. Sometimes, however,
                            all application inputs are sanitized, but the sanitizations are not appropriate
                            for the browser contexts of the sanitized values. Using an incorrect sanitizer
                            can make the application look protected, when it is in fact vulnerable as if no
                            sanitization was used, creating a context-sensitive XSS flaw.
                            <br />To discover context-sensitive XSS flaws, we introduce DjangoChecker.
                            DjangoChecker combines extended dynamic taint tracking with a model browser for
                            context analysis. We demonstrate the practical application of DjangoChecker on
                            eight mature web applications based on Django, discovering previously unknown
                            flaws in seven of the eight applications, including highly severe flaws that
                            allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the seven flawed applications.

                            We introduce an open-source toolkit, i.e., the deep Self End-to-end Learning
                            Framework (deepSELF), as a toolkit of deep self end-to-end learning framework
                            for multi-modal signals. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first public
                            toolkit assembling a series of state-of-the-art deep learning technologies.
                            Highlights of the proposed deepSELF toolkit include: First, it can be used to
                            analyse a variety of multi-modal signals, including images, audio, and single
                            or multi-channel sensor data. Second, we provide multiple options for
                            pre-processing, e.g., filtering, or spectrum image generation by Fourier or
                            wavelet transformation. Third, plenty of topologies in terms of NN, 1D/2D/3D
                            CNN, and RNN/LSTM/GRU can be customised and a series of pretrained 2D CNN
                            models, e.g., AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet can be used easily. Last but not least,
                            above these features, deepSELF can be flexibly used not only as a single model
                            but also as a fusion of such.

                            We study sparse recovery with structured random measurement matrices having
                            independent, identically distributed, and uniformly bounded rows and with a
                            nontrivial covariance structure. This class of matrices arises from random
                            sampling of bounded Riesz systems and generalizes random partial Fourier
                            matrices. Our main result improves the currently available results for the null
                            space and restricted isometry properties of such random matrices. The main
                            novelty of our analysis is a new upper bound for the expectation of the
                            supremum of a Bernoulli process associated with a restricted isometry constant.
                            We apply our result to prove new performance guarantees for the CORSING method,

                            differential equations (PDEs) based on compressive sensing.

                            requires localized on-demand generation of the micro-structure since the
                            full-scale storing and retrieving is cost prohibitive. When the micro-structure
                            is efficiently represented as the image of a canonical structure under a
                            non-linear space deformation to allow it to conform to curved shape, the
                            additional challenge is to relate the query of the mapped micro-structure back
                            to its canonical structure. This paper presents an efficient algorithm to pull
                            back a mapped micro-structure to a partition of the canonical domain structure
                            into boxes and only activates boxes whose image is likely intersected by a
                            plane. The active boxes are organized into a forest whose trees are traversed
                            depth first to generate mapped micro-structure only of the active boxes. The
                            traversal supports, for example, 3D print slice generation in additive
                            manufacturing.

                            Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm to achieve
                            high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless networks by
                            reconfiguring the wireless signal propagation via passive reflection. To reap
                            the potential gains of IRS, channel state information (CSI) is essential,
                            whereas channel estimation errors are inevitable in practice due to limited
                            channel training resources. In this paper, in order to optimize the performance
                            of IRS-aided multiuser systems with imperfect CSI, we propose to jointly design
                            the active transmit precoding at the access point (AP) and passive reflection
                            coefficients of IRS, each consisting of not only the conventional phase shift
                            and also the newly exploited amplitude variation. First, the achievable rate of
                            each user is derived assuming a practical IRS channel estimation method, which
                            shows that the interference due to CSI errors is intricately related to the AP
                            transmit precoders, the channel training power and the IRS reflection
                            coefficients during both channel training and data transmission. Then, for the
                            single-user case, by combining the benefits of the penalty method, Dinkelbach
                            method and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method, a new
                            penalized Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm is proposed to optimize the IRS reflection
                            coefficients for maximizing the achievable data transmission rate subjected to
                            CSI errors; while for the multiuser case, a new penalty dual decomposition
                            (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the users' weighted sum-rate.
                            Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
                            algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. In particular, useful insights are
                            drawn to characterize the effect of IRS reflection amplitude control
                            (with/without the conventional phase shift) on the system performance under
                            imperfect CSI.

                            A recent article proposed reduced mutual information for evaluation of
                            clustering, classification and community detection. The motivation is that the
                            standard normalized mutual information (NMI) may give counter-intuitive answers
                            under certain conditions and particularly when the number of clusters differs
                            between the two divisions under consideration. The motivation makes sense.
                            However, the examples given in the article are not accurate, and this comment
                            discusses why. In addition, this comment also empirically demonstrates that the
                            reduced mutual information cannot handle the difficulties of NMI and even
                            brings more. The necessity of Kappa is also empirically validated in this
                            comment.

                            In this paper, we present a mathematical and numerical model for blood
                            solidification and its rupture in stenosed arteries. The interaction between
                            the blood flow and an existing stenosis in the arterial wall is modeled as a
                            three dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem. The blood is assumed to
                            be a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid with a time-dependent viscosity that
                            obeys a modified Carreau's model and the flow dynamics is described by the
                            Navier-Stokes equations. Whereas, the arterial wall is considered a
                            hyperelastic material whose displacement satisfies the quasi-static equilibrium
                            equations. Numerical simulations are performed using FreeFem++ on a two
                            dimensional domain. We investigate the behavior of the viscosity of blood, its
                            speed and the maximum shear stress. From the numerical results, blood
                            recirculation zones have been identified. Moreover, a zone of the blood of high
                            viscosity and low speed has been observed directly after the stenosis in the
                            flow direction. This zone may correspond to a blood accumulation and then
                            solidification zone that is subjected to shear stress by the blood flow and to
                            forces exerted by the artery wall deformation. Therefore, this zone is thought
                            to break and then to release a blood clot that leads to the occlusion of small
                            arterioles.

                            With the development of the Internet, social media has become an essential
                            channel for posting disaster-related information. Analyzing attitudes hidden in
                            these texts, known as sentiment analysis, is crucial for the government or
                            relief agencies to improve disaster response efficiency, but it has not
                            received sufficient attention. This paper aims to fill this gap by focusing on
                            investigating public attitudes towards disaster response and analyzing targeted
                            relief supplies during disaster relief. The research comprises four steps.
                            First, this paper implements Python in grasping Twitter data, and then, we
                            assess public perceptron quantitatively by these opinioned texts, which contain
                            information like the demand for targeted relief supplies, satisfactions of
                            disaster response and fear of the public. A natural disaster dataset with
                            sentiment labels is created, which contains 49,816 Twitter data about natural
                            disasters in the United States. Second, this paper proposes eight machine
                            learning models for sentiment prediction, which are the most popular models
                            used in classification problems. Third, the comparison of these models is
                            conducted via various metrics, and this paper also discusses the optimization
                            method of these models from the perspective of model parameters and input data
                            structures. Finally, a set of real-world instances are studied from the
                            perspective of analyzing changes of public opinion during different natural
                            disasters and understanding the relationship between the same hazard and time
                            series. Results in this paper demonstrate the feasibility and validation of the
                            proposed research approach and provide relief agencies with insights into
                            better disaster response.

                            the Colebrook equation for flow friction. The presented approximations are
                            based on the asymptotic series expansion of the Wright Omega-function and
                            symbolic regression. The results are verified with 8 million of Quasi-Monte
                            Carlo points covering the domain of interest for engineers. In comparison with
                            the built-in wrightOmega feature of Matlab R2016a, the herein introduced
                            related approximations of the Wright Omega-function significantly accelerate
                            the computation. With only two logarithms and several basic arithmetic
                            operations used, the presented approximations are not only computationally
                            efficient but also extremely accurate. The maximal relative error of the most
                            promising approximation which is given in the form suitable for engineers use
                            is limited to 0.0012%, while for a little bit more complex variant is limited
                            to 0.000024%.

                            Deep Reinforcement Learning has proved to be able to solve many control tasks
                            in different fields, but the behavior of these systems is not always as
                            expected when deployed in real-world scenarios. This is mainly due to the lack
                            of domain adaptation between simulated and real-world data together with the
                            absence of distinction between train and test datasets. In this work, we
                            investigate these problems in the autonomous driving field, especially for a
                            maneuver planning module for roundabout insertions. In particular, we present a
                            system based on multiple environments in which agents are trained
                            simultaneously, evaluating the behavior of the model in different scenarios.
                            Finally, we analyze techniques aimed at reducing the gap between simulated and
                            real-world data showing that this increased the generalization capabilities of
                            the system both on unseen and real-world scenarios.

                            Emotional voice conversion aims to convert the emotion of the speech from one
                            state to another while preserving the linguistic content and speaker identity.
                            The prior studies on emotional voice conversion are mostly carried out under
                            the assumption that emotion is speaker-dependent. We believe that emotions are
                            expressed universally across speakers, therefore, the speaker-independent
                            mapping between emotional states of speech is possible. In this paper, we
                            propose to build a speaker-independent emotional voice conversion framework,
                            that can convert anyone's emotion without the need for parallel data. We
                            propose a VAW-GAN based encoder-decoder structure to learn the spectrum and
                            prosody mapping. We perform prosody conversion by using continuous wavelet
                            transform (CWT) to model the temporal dependencies. We also investigate the use
                            of F0 as an additional input to the decoder to improve emotion conversion
                            performance. Experiments show that the proposed speaker-independent framework
                            achieves competitive results for both seen and unseen speakers.

                            We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to minimize pseudo-Boolean functions.
                            The computational complexity is $O\left( n^{\frac{15}{2}}\right) $, although
                            very conservative, it is sufficient to prove that this minimization problem is

                            of order $O\left( n^{\frac{45}{2}}\right) $. The algorithm was implemented in

                            The ability to detect anomalies in time series is considered as highly
                            valuable within plenty of application domains. The sequential nature of time
                            series objects is responsible for an additional feature complexity, ultimately
                            requiring specialized approaches for solving the task. Essential
                            characteristics of time series, laying outside the time domain, are often
                            difficult to capture with state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, when no
                            transformations on the time series have been applied. Inspired by the success
                            of deep learning methods in computer vision, several studies have proposed to
                            transform time-series into image-like representations, leading to very
                            promising results. However, most of the previous studies implementing
                            time-series to image encodings have focused on the supervised classification.
                            The application to unsupervised anomaly detection tasks has been limited.
                            <br />The paper has the following contributions: First, we evaluate the application
                            of six time-series to image encodings to DL algorithms: Gramian Angular Field,
                            Markov Transition Field, Recurrence Plot, Grey Scale Encoding, Spectrogram and
                            Scalogram. Second, we propose modifications of the original encoding
                            definitions, to make them more robust to the variability in large datasets. And
                            third, we provide a comprehensive comparison between using the raw time series
                            directly and the different encodings, with and without the proposed
                            improvements. The comparison is performed on a dataset collected and released
                            by Airbus, containing highly complex vibration measurements from real
                            helicopters flight tests. The different encodings provide competitive results
                            for anomaly detection.

                            sequences. Particularly, instead of directly measuring the similarity of two
                            sequences by any metric/approach, the proposed SS works in a way to evaluate
                            how more likely will the undesirable hybridizations occur over the desirable
                            hybridizations in the presence of the two measured sequences and their RC
                            pairs. With this SS model, we construct thermodynamically stable DNA codes
                            subject to several combinatorial constraints using a sorting-based algorithm.
                            The proposed scheme results in DNA codes with larger code sizes and wider free
                            energy gaps (hence better cross-hybridization performance) compared to the
                            existing methods.

                            In this paper, we introduce DeepFake, a novel deep reinforcement
                            learning-based deception strategy to deal with reactive jamming attacks. In
                            particular, for a smart and reactive jamming attack, the jammer is able to
                            sense the channel and attack the channel if it detects communications from the
                            legitimate transmitter. To deal with such attacks, we propose an intelligent
                            deception strategy which allows the legitimate transmitter to transmit "fake"
                            signals to attract the jammer. Then, if the jammer attacks the channel, the
                            transmitter can leverage the strong jamming signals to transmit data by using
                            ambient backscatter communication technology or harvest energy from the strong
                            jamming signals for future use. By doing so, we can not only undermine the
                            attack ability of the jammer, but also utilize jamming signals to improve the
                            system performance. To effectively learn from and adapt to the dynamic and
                            uncertainty of jamming attacks, we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning
                            algorithm using the deep dueling neural network architecture to obtain the
                            optimal policy with thousand times faster than those of the conventional
                            reinforcement algorithms. Extensive simulation results reveal that our proposed
                            DeepFake framework is superior to other anti-jamming strategies in terms of
                            throughput, packet loss, and learning rate.

                            Efficiency criteria for conformal prediction, such as \emph{observed
                            fuzziness} (i.e., the sum of p-values associated with false labels), are
                            commonly used to \emph{evaluate} the performance of given conformal predictors.
                            Here, we investigate whether it is possible to exploit efficiency criteria to
                            \emph{learn} classifiers, both conformal predictors and point classifiers, by
                            using such criteria as training objective functions. The proposed idea is
                            implemented for the problem of binary classification of hand-written digits. By
                            choosing a 1-dimensional model class (with one real-valued free parameter), we
                            can solve the optimization problems through an (approximate) exhaustive search
                            over (a discrete version of) the parameter space. Our empirical results suggest
                            that conformal predictors trained by minimizing their observed fuzziness
                            perform better than conformal predictors trained in the traditional way by
                            minimizing the \emph{prediction error} of the corresponding point classifier.
                            They also have a reasonable performance in terms of their prediction error on
                            the test set.

                            In this paper, we consider the problem of communication-efficient
                            decentralized training of large-scale machine learning models over a network.
                            We propose and analyze SQuARM-SGD, an algorithm for decentralized training,
                            which employs {\em momentum} and {\em compressed communication} between nodes
                            regulated by a locally computable triggering condition in stochastic gradient
                            descent (SGD). In SQuARM-SGD, each node performs a fixed number of local SGD
                            steps using Nesterov's momentum and then sends sparisified and quantized
                            updates to its neighbors only when there is a significant change in the model
                            parameters since the last time communication occurred. We provide convergence
                            guarantees of our algorithm for (smooth) strongly convex and non-convex
                            objectives, and show that SQuARM-SGD converges at a rate of
                            $\mathcal{O}\left(\nicefrac{1}{nT}\right)$ for strongly convex objectives,
                            while for non-convex objectives it convergences at a rate of
                            $\mathcal{O}\left(\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{nT}}\right)$, thus matching the
                            convergence rate of \emph{vanilla} distributed SGD in both these settings. We
                            corroborate our theoretical understanding with experiments and compare the
                            performance of our algorithm with the state-of-the-art, showing that without
                            sacrificing much on the accuracy, SQuARM-SGD converges at a similar rate while
                            saving significantly in total communicated bits.

                            Greville's method has been utilized in (Broad Learn-ing System) BLS to
                            propose an effective and efficient incremental learning system without
                            retraining the whole network from the beginning. For a column-partitioned
                            matrix where the second part consists of p columns, Greville's method requires
                            p iterations to compute the pseudoinverse of the whole matrix from the
                            pseudoinverse of the first part. The incremental algorithms in BLS extend
                            Greville's method to compute the pseudoinverse of the whole matrix from the
                            pseudoinverse of the first part by just 1 iteration, which have neglected some
                            possible cases, and need further improvements in efficiency and numerical
                            stability. In this paper, we propose an efficient and numerical stable
                            algorithm from Greville's method, to compute the pseudoinverse of the whole
                            matrix from the pseudoinverse of the first part by just 1 iteration, where all
                            possible cases are considered, and the recently proposed inverse Cholesky
                            factorization can be applied to further reduce the computational complexity.
                            Finally, we give the whole algorithm for column-partitioned matrices in BLS. On
                            the other hand, we also give the proposed algorithm for row-partitioned
                            matrices in BLS.

                            Instance segmentation is one of the actively studied research topics in
                            computer vision in which many objects of interest should be separated
                            individually. While many feed-forward networks produce high-quality
                            segmentation on different types of images, their results often suffer from

                            extract a single object at a time using discriminative knowledge-based
                            properties (shapes, boundaries, etc.) without relying on post-processing, but
                            they do not scale well. To exploit the advantages of conventional
                            single-object-per-step segmentation methods without impairing the scalability,
                            we propose a novel iterative deep reinforcement learning agent that learns how
                            to differentiate multiple objects in parallel. Our reward function for the
                            trainable agent is designed to favor grouping pixels belonging to the same
                            object using a graph coloring algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed
                            method can efficiently perform instance segmentation of many objects without
                            heavy post-processing.

                            The generality and pervasiness of category theory in modern mathematics makes
                            it a frequent and useful target of formalization. It is however quite
                            challenging to formalize, for a variety of reasons. Agda currently (i.e. in
                            2020) does not have a standard, working formalization of category theory. We
                            document our work on solving this dilemma. The formalization revealed a number
                            of potential design choices, and we present, motivate and explain the ones we
                            picked. In particular, we find that alternative definitions or alternative
                            proofs from those found in standard textbooks can be advantageous, as well as
                            "fit" Agda's type theory more smoothly. Some definitions regarded as equivalent
                            in standard textbooks turn out to make different "universe level" assumptions,
                            with some being more polymorphic than others. We also pay close attention to
                            engineering issues, in particular so that the library integrates well with
                            Agda's own standard library, as well as supporting as many of the modes of Agda
                            as possible.

                            The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of in-silico
                            epidemiological modelling in predicting the dynamics of infectious diseases to
                            inform health policy and decision makers about suitable prevention and
                            containment strategies. Work in this setting involves solving challenging
                            inference and control problems in individual-based models of ever increasing
                            complexity. Here we discuss recent breakthroughs in machine learning,
                            specifically in simulation-based inference, and explore its potential as a
                            novel venue for model calibration to support the design and evaluation of
                            public health interventions. To further stimulate research, we are developing

                            We present a method for combining multi-agent communication and traditional
                            data-driven approaches to natural language learning, with an end goal of
                            teaching agents to communicate with humans in natural language. Our starting
                            point is a language model that has been trained on generic, not task-specific
                            language data. We then place this model in a multi-agent self-play environment
                            that generates task-specific rewards used to adapt or modulate the model,
                            turning it into a task-conditional language model. We introduce a new way for
                            combining the two types of learning based on the idea of reranking language
                            model samples, and show that this method outperforms others in communicating
                            with humans in a visual referential communication task. Finally, we present a
                            taxonomy of different types of language drift that can occur alongside a set of
                            measures to detect them.

                            In this study, we present an model-based approach to recognize full 26
                            degrees of freedom of a human hand. Input data include RGB-D images acquired
                            from a Kinect camera and a 3D model of the hand constructed from its anatomy
                            and graphical matrices. A cost function is then defined so that its minimum
                            value is achieved when the model and observation images are matched. To solve
                            the optimization problem in 26 dimensional space, the particle swarm
                            optimization algorimth with improvements are used. In addition, parallel
                            computation in graphical processing units (GPU) is utilized to handle
                            computationally expensive tasks. Simulation and experimental results show that
                            the system can recognize 26 degrees of freedom of hands with the processing
                            time of 0.8 seconds per frame. The algorithm is robust to noise and the
                            hardware requirement is simple with a single camera.

                            We discuss the possibility to learn a data-driven explicit model correction
                            for inverse problems and whether such a model correction can be used within a
                            variational framework to obtain regularised reconstructions. This paper

                            explicitly corrects in both data and solution spaces. We then derive conditions
                            under which solutions to the variational problem with a learned correction
                            converge to solutions obtained with the correct operator. The proposed approach
                            is evaluated on an application to limited view photoacoustic tomography and
                            compared to the established framework of Bayesian approximation error method.

                            Deep reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to many control
                            tasks, but the application of such agents in safety-critical scenarios has been
                            limited due to safety concerns. Rigorous testing of these controllers is
                            challenging, particularly when they operate in probabilistic environments due
                            to, for example, hardware faults or noisy sensors. We propose MOSAIC, an
                            algorithm for measuring the safety of deep reinforcement learning agents in
                            stochastic settings. Our approach is based on the iterative construction of a
                            formal abstraction of a controller's execution in an environment, and leverages
                            probabilistic model checking of Markov decision processes to produce
                            probabilistic guarantees on safe behaviour over a finite time horizon. It
                            produces bounds on the probability of safe operation of the controller for
                            different initial configurations and identifies regions where correct behaviour
                            can be guaranteed. We implement and evaluate our approach on agents trained for
                            several benchmark control problems.

                            The objective of this paper is to separate a target speaker's speech from a
                            mixture of two speakers using a deep audio-visual speech separation network.
                            Unlike previous works that used lip movement on video clips or pre-enrolled
                            speaker information as an auxiliary conditional feature, we use a single face
                            image of the target speaker. In this task, the conditional feature is obtained
                            from facial appearance in cross-modal biometric task, where audio and visual
                            identity representations are shared in latent space. Learnt identities from
                            facial images enforce the network to isolate matched speakers and extract the
                            voices from mixed speech. It solves the permutation problem caused by swapped
                            channel outputs, frequently occurred in speech separation tasks. The proposed
                            method is far more practical than video-based speech separation since user
                            profile images are readily available on many platforms. Also, unlike
                            speaker-aware separation methods, it is applicable on separation with unseen
                            speakers who have never been enrolled before. We show strong qualitative and
                            quantitative results on challenging real-world examples.

                            Dictionary learning for sparse representations has been successful in many
                            reconstruction tasks. Simplicial learning is an adaptation of dictionary
                            learning, where subspaces become clipped and acquire arbitrary offsets, taking
                            the form of simplices. Such adaptation is achieved through additional
                            constraints on sparse codes. Furthermore, an evolutionary approach can be
                            chosen to determine the number and the dimensionality of simplices composing
                            the simplicial, in which most generative and compact simplicials are favored.
                            This paper proposes an evolutionary simplicial learning method as a generative
                            and compact sparse framework for classification. The proposed approach is first
                            applied on a one-class classification task and it appears as the most reliable
                            method within the considered benchmark. Most surprising results are observed
                            when evolutionary simplicial learning is considered within a multi-class
                            classification task. Since sparse representations are generative in nature,
                            they bear a fundamental problem of not being capable of distinguishing two
                            classes lying on the same subspace. This claim is validated through synthetic
                            experiments and superiority of simplicial learning even as a generative-only
                            approach is demonstrated. Simplicial learning loses its superiority over
                            discriminative methods in high-dimensional cases but can further be modified
                            with discriminative elements to achieve state-of-the-art performance in
                            classification tasks.

                            Recently, with the development of deep learning, end-to-end neural network
                            architectures have been increasingly applied to condition monitoring signals.
                            They have demonstrated superior performance for fault detection and
                            classification, in particular using convolutional neural networks. Even more
                            recently, an extension of the concept of convolution to the concept of
                            kervolution has been proposed with some promising results in image
                            classification tasks. In this paper, we explore the potential of kervolutional
                            neural networks applied to time series data. We demonstrate that using a
                            mixture of convolutional and kervolutional layers improves the model
                            performance. The mixed model is first applied to a classification task in time
                            series, as a benchmark dataset. Subsequently, the proposed mixed architecture
                            is used to detect anomalies in time series data recorded by accelerometers on
                            helicopters. We propose a residual-based anomaly detection approach using a
                            temporal auto-encoder. We demonstrate that mixing kervolutional with
                            convolutional layers in the encoder is more sensitive to variations in the
                            input data and is able to detect anomalous time series in a better way.

                            Over the past decade, undergraduate Computer Science (CS) programs across the
                            nation have experienced an explosive growth in enrollment as computational
                            skills have proven increasingly important across many domains and in the
                            workforce at large. Motivated by this unprecedented student demand, the CS
                            program at the University of California, Berkeley has tripled the size of its
                            graduating class in five years. The first two introductory courses for majors,
                            each taught by one faculty instructor and several hundred student teachers,
                            combine to serve nearly 2,900 students per term. This report presents three
                            strategies that have enabled the effective teaching, delivery, and management
                            of large-scale CS courses: (1) the development of autograder infrastructure and
                            online platforms to provide instant feedback with minimal instructor
                            intervention and deliver the course at scale; (2) the expansion of academic and
                            social student support networks resulting from changes in teaching assistant
                            responsibilities and the development of several near-peer mentoring
                            communities; and (3) the expansion of undergraduate teacher preparation
                            programs to meet the increased demand for qualified student teachers. These
                            interventions have helped both introductory and advanced courses address
                            capacity challenges and expand enrollments while receiving among the highest
                            student evaluations of teaching in department history. Implications for
                            inclusivity and diversity are discussed.

                            This paper describes a statistically-principled semi-supervised method of
                            automatic chord estimation (ACE) that can make effective use of any music
                            signals regardless of the availability of chord annotations. The typical
                            approach to ACE is to train a deep classification model (neural chord
                            estimator) in a supervised manner by using only a limited amount of annotated
                            music signals. In this discriminative approach, prior knowledge about chord
                            label sequences (characteristics of model output) has scarcely been taken into
                            account. In contract, we propose a unified generative and discriminative
                            approach in the framework of amortized variational inference. More
                            specifically, we formulate a deep generative model that represents the complex
                            generative process of chroma vectors (observed variables) from the discrete
                            labels and continuous textures of chords (latent variables). Chord labels and
                            textures are assumed to follow a Markov model favoring self-transitions and a
                            standard Gaussian distribution, respectively. Given chroma vectors as observed
                            data, the posterior distributions of latent chord labels and textures are
                            computed approximately by using deep classification and recognition models,
                            respectively. These three models are combined to form a variational autoencoder
                            and trained jointly in a semi-supervised manner. The experimental results show
                            that the performance of the classification model can be improved by
                            additionally using non-annotated music signals and/or by regularizing the
                            classification model with the Markov model of chord labels and the generative
                            model of chroma vectors even in the fully-supervised condition.

                            We introduce Bayesian Bits, a practical method for joint mixed precision
                            quantization and pruning through gradient based optimization. Bayesian Bits
                            employs a novel decomposition of the quantization operation, which sequentially
                            considers doubling the bit width. At each new bit width, the residual error
                            between the full precision value and the previously rounded value is quantized.
                            We then decide whether or not to add this quantized residual error for a higher
                            effective bit width and lower quantization noise. By starting with a
                            power-of-two bit width, this decomposition will always produce
                            hardware-friendly configurations, and through an additional 0-bit option,
                            serves as a unified view of pruning and quantization. Bayesian Bits then
                            introduces learnable stochastic gates, which collectively control the bit width
                            of the given tensor. As a result, we can obtain low bit solutions by performing
                            approximate inference over the gates, with prior distributions that encourage
                            most of them to be switched off. We further show that, under some assumptions,
                            L0 regularization of the network parameters corresponds to a specific instance
                            of the aforementioned framework. We experimentally validate our proposed method
                            on several benchmark datasets and show that we can learn pruned, mixed
                            precision networks that provide a better trade-off between accuracy and
                            efficiency than their static bit width equivalents.

                            Shortlisting is the task of reducing a long list of alternatives to a
                            (smaller) set of best or most suitable alternatives from which a final winner
                            will be chosen. Shortlisting is often used in the nomination process of awards
                            or in recommender systems to display featured objects. In this paper, we
                            analyze shortlisting methods that are based on approval data, a common type of
                            preferences. Furthermore, we assume that the size of the shortlist, i.e., the
                            number of best or most suitable alternatives, is not fixed but determined by
                            the shortlisting method. We axiomatically analyze established and new
                            shortlisting methods and complement this analysis with an experimental
                            evaluation based on biased voters and noisy quality estimates. Our results lead
                            to recommendations which shortlisting methods to use, depending on the desired
                            properties.

                            Visual crowd counting has been recently studied as a way to enable people
                            counting in crowd scenes from images. Albeit successful, vision-based crowd
                            counting approaches could fail to capture informative features in extreme
                            conditions, e.g., imaging at night and occlusion. In this work, we introduce a
                            novel task of audiovisual crowd counting, in which visual and auditory
                            information are integrated for counting purposes. We collect a large-scale
                            benchmark, named auDiovISual Crowd cOunting (DISCO) dataset, consisting of
                            1,935 images and the corresponding audio clips, and 170,270 annotated
                            instances. In order to fuse the two modalities, we make use of a linear
                            feature-wise fusion module that carries out an affine transformation on visual
                            and auditory features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using the
                            proposed dataset and approach. Experimental results show that introducing
                            auditory information can benefit crowd counting under different illumination,
                            noise, and occlusion conditions. The dataset and code will be released. Code

                            Adversarial attacks against conventional Deep Learning (DL) systems and
                            algorithms have been widely studied, and various defenses were proposed.
                            However, the possibility and feasibility of such attacks against Deep
                            Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are less explored. As DRL has achieved great
                            success in various complex tasks, designing effective adversarial attacks is an
                            indispensable prerequisite towards building robust DRL algorithms. In this
                            paper, we introduce two novel adversarial attack techniques to
                            \emph{stealthily} and \emph{efficiently} attack the DRL agents. These two
                            techniques enable an adversary to inject adversarial samples in a minimal set
                            of critical moments while causing the most severe damage to the agent. The
                            first technique is the \emph{critical point attack}: the adversary builds a
                            model to predict the future environmental states and agent's actions, assesses
                            the damage of each possible attack strategy, and selects the optimal one. The
                            second technique is the \emph{antagonist attack}: the adversary automatically
                            learns a domain-agnostic model to discover the critical moments of attacking
                            the agent in an episode. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
                            our techniques. Specifically, to successfully attack the DRL agent, our
                            critical point technique only requires 1 (TORCS) or 2 (Atari Pong and Breakout)
                            steps, and the antagonist technique needs fewer than 5 steps (4 Mujoco tasks),
                            which are significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

                            In many documents, such as semi-structured webpages, textual semantics are
                            augmented with additional information conveyed using visual elements including
                            layout, font size, and color. Prior work on information extraction from
                            semi-structured websites has required learning an extraction model specific to
                            a given template via either manually labeled or distantly supervised data from
                            that template. In this work, we propose a solution for "zero-shot" open-domain
                            relation extraction from webpages with a previously unseen template, including
                            from websites with little overlap with existing sources of knowledge for
                            distant supervision and websites in entirely new subject verticals. Our model
                            uses a graph neural network-based approach to build a rich representation of
                            text fields on a webpage and the relationships between them, enabling
                            generalization to new templates. Experiments show this approach provides a 31%
                            F1 gain over a baseline for zero-shot extraction in a new subject vertical.

                            Not so long ago, a method was discovered that successfully overcomes the
                            catastrophic forgetting of neural networks. Although we know about the cases of
                            using this method to preserve skills when adapting pre-trained networks to
                            particular tasks, it has not yet obtained widespread distribution. In this
                            paper, we would like to propose an alternative method of overcoming
                            catastrophic forgetting based on the total absolute signal passing through each
                            connection in the network. This method has a simple implementation and seems to
                            us essentially close to the processes occurring in the brain of animals to
                            preserve previously learned skills during subsequent learning. We hope that the
                            ease of implementation of this method will serve its wide application.

                            Optical cameras are gaining popularity as the suitable sensor for relative
                            navigation in space due to their attractive sizing, power and cost properties
                            when compared to conventional flight hardware or costly laser-based systems.
                            However, a camera cannot infer depth information on its own, which is often
                            solved by introducing complementary sensors or a second camera. In this paper,
                            an innovative model-based approach is instead demonstrated to estimate the
                            six-dimensional pose of a target object relative to the chaser spacecraft using
                            solely a monocular setup. The observed facet of the target is tackled as a
                            classification problem, where the three-dimensional shape is learned offline
                            using Gaussian mixture modeling. The estimate is refined by minimizing two
                            different robust loss functions based on local feature correspondences. The
                            resulting pseudo-measurements are then processed and fused with an extended
                            Kalman filter. The entire optimization framework is designed to operate
                            directly on the $SE\text{(3)}$ manifold, uncoupling the process and measurement
                            models from the global attitude state representation. It is validated on
                            realistic synthetic and laboratory datasets of a rendezvous trajectory with the
                            complex spacecraft Envisat. It is demonstrated how it achieves an estimate of
                            the relative pose with high accuracy over its full tumbling motion.

                            Several previous studies on explanation for recurrent neural networks focus
                            on approaches that find the most important input segments for a network as its
                            explanations. In that case, the manner in which these input segments combine
                            with each other to form an explanatory pattern remains unknown. To overcome
                            this, some previous work tries to find patterns (called rules) in the data that
                            explain neural outputs. However, their explanations are often insensitive to
                            model parameters, which limits the scalability of text explanations. To
                            overcome these limitations, we propose a pipeline to explain RNNs by means of
                            decision lists (also called rules) over skipgrams. For evaluation of
                            explanations, we create a synthetic sepsis-identification dataset, as well as
                            apply our technique on additional clinical and sentiment analysis datasets. We
                            find that our technique persistently achieves high explanation fidelity and
                            qualitatively interpretable rules.

                            An $(a,b,\tau)$ streaming code is a packet-level erasure code that can
                            recover under a strict delay constraint of $\tau$ time units, from either a
                            burst of $b$ erasures or else of $a$ random erasures, occurring within a
                            sliding window of time duration $w$. While rate-optimal constructions of such
                            streaming codes are available for all parameters $\{a,b,\tau,w\}$ in the
                            literature, they require in most instances, a quadratic, $O(\tau^2)$ field
                            size. In this work, we make further progress towards field size reduction and
                            present rate-optimal $O(\tau)$ field size streaming codes for two regimes: (i)
                            $gcd(b,\tau+1-a)\ge a$ (ii) $\tau+1 \ge a+b$ and $b \mod \ a \in \{0,a-1\}$.

                            The ability to recognize objects despite there being differences in
                            appearance, known as Core Object Recognition, forms a critical part of human
                            perception. While it is understood that the brain accomplishes Core Object
                            Recognition through feedforward, hierarchical computations through the visual
                            stream, the underlying algorithms that allow for invariant representations to
                            form downstream is still not well understood. (DiCarlo et al., 2012) Various
                            computational perceptual models have been built to attempt and tackle the
                            object identification task in an artificial perceptual setting. Artificial
                            Neural Networks, computational graphs consisting of weighted edges and
                            mathematical operations at vertices, are loosely inspired by neural networks in
                            the brain and have proven effective at various visual perceptual tasks,
                            including object characterization and identification. (Pinto et al., 2008)
                            (DiCarlo et al., 2012) For many data analysis tasks, learning representations
                            where each dimension is statistically independent and thus disentangled from
                            the others is useful. If the underlying generative factors of the data are also
                            statistically independent, Bayesian inference of latent variables can form
                            disentangled representations. This thesis constitutes a research project
                            exploring a generalization of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), $\beta$-VAE,
                            that aims to learn disentangled representations using variational inference.
                            $\beta$-VAE incorporates the hyperparameter $\beta$, and enforces conditional
                            independence of its bottleneck neurons, which is in general not compatible with
                            the statistical independence of latent variables. This text examines this
                            architecture, and provides analytical and numerical arguments, with the goal of
                            demonstrating that this incompatibility leads to a non-monotonic inference
                            performance in $\beta$-VAE with a finite optimal $\beta$.

                            In this work, we are interested in the large graph similarity computation
                            problem, which is one of the most important graph-based problems. Traditional
                            techniques to compute the exact or approximate values of Graph Edit Distance
                            (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) require at least polynomial time
                            complexity over node numbers thus are not able to handle this problem when the
                            numbers of nodes are large. Recently the develop of deep learning techniques
                            provide a promising solution for this problem by training a network which is
                            able to encode graphs to feature vectors and then compute similarity based on
                            feature vectors. However, when we look into these techniques and classify them
                            to embedding models and matching models, problems arise. Embedding models can
                            be quite fast but perform poorly due to the lack of interaction across graphs
                            while matching models involve this for much better performance but satisfy far
                            more on time consumption. Similar to the process of large biological molecular
                            identification, where we first maps the whole molecular to molecular groups and
                            then identify them based on the "abstracted smaller molecular", the feature
                            aggregation across two whole graphs is always redundant, especially when the
                            number of nodes is large. Thus we here present a novel framework for large
                            graph similarity computation problem. We first embed and coarsen the large
                            graphs to "abstracted smaller graphs" with denser local topology, similar to
                            molecular groups in biological concept. Then we aggregate both the internal
                            features in "abstracted smaller graphs" and external features across
                            "abstracted smaller graph pair", leading to feature vectors for each graph,
                            with which we calculate the final similarity score. Experiments demonstrate
                            that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph
                            similarity computation tasks and has significant improvement in time
                            efficiency.

                            This paper presents an iterative data-driven algorithm for solving dynamic
                            multi-objective (MO) optimal control problems arising in control of nonlinear
                            continuous-time systems. It is first shown that the Hamiltonian functional
                            corresponding to each objective can be leveraged to compare the performance of
                            admissible policies. Hamiltonian-inequalities are then used for which their
                            satisfaction guarantees satisfying the objectives' aspirations. An
                            aspiration-satisfying dynamic optimization framework is then presented to
                            optimize the main objective while satisfying the aspiration of other
                            objectives. Relation to satisficing (good enough) decision-making framework is
                            shown. An infinite-dimensional linear program (LP) algorithm is developed to
                            solve the formulated aspiration-satisfying MO optimization. To obviate the
                            requirement of complete knowledge of the system dynamics, a data-driven
                            satisficing reinforcement learning approach that uses measured data and a value

                            Finally, two simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the

                            Increasing attention to autonomous passenger vehicles has also attracted
                            interest in an autonomous racing series. Because of this, platforms such as
                            Roborace and the Indy Autonomous Challenge are currently evolving. Electric
                            racecars face the challenge of a limited amount of stored energy within their
                            batteries. Furthermore, the thermodynamical influence of an all-electric
                            powertrain on the race performance is crucial. Severe damage can occur to the
                            powertrain components when thermally overstressed. In this work we present a
                            race-time minimal control strategy deduced from an Optimal Control Problem
                            (OCP) that is transcribed into a Nonlinear Problem (NLP). Its optimization
                            variables stem from the driving dynamics as well as from a thermodynamical
                            description of the electric powertrain. We deduce the necessary first-order
                            Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)s and form simplified loss models for the
                            implementation within the numerical optimization. The significant influence of
                            the powertrain behavior on the race strategy is shown.

                            The correctness of networks is often described in terms of the individual
                            data flow of components instead of their global behavior. In software-defined
                            networks, it is far more convenient to specify the correct behavior of packets
                            than the global behavior of the entire network. Petri nets with transits extend
                            Petri nets and Flow-LTL extends LTL such that the data flows of tokens can be
                            tracked. We present the tool AdamMC as the first model checker for Petri nets
                            with transits against Flow-LTL. We describe how AdamMC can automatically encode
                            concurrent updates of software-defined networks as Petri nets with transits and
                            how common network specifications can be expressed in Flow-LTL. Underlying
                            AdamMC is a reduction to a circuit model checking problem. We introduce a new
                            reduction method that results in tremendous performance improvements compared
                            to a previous prototype. Thereby, AdamMC can handle software-defined networks
                            with up to 82 switches.

                            Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs achieve outstanding performance on
                            various tasks, their high computation demand and massive number of parameters
                            make it difficult to deploy these SOTA CNNs onto resource-constrained devices.
                            Previous works on CNN acceleration utilize low-rank approximation of the
                            original convolution layers to reduce computation cost. However, these methods
                            are very difficult to conduct upon sparse models, which limits execution
                            speedup since redundancies within the CNN model are not fully exploited. We
                            argue that kernel granularity decomposition can be conducted with low-rank
                            assumption while exploiting the redundancy within the remaining compact
                            coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose PENNI, a CNN model
                            compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware
                            efficiency simultaneously by (1) implementing kernel sharing in convolution
                            layers via a small number of basis kernels and (2) alternately adjusting bases
                            and coefficients with sparse constraints. Experiments show that we can prune
                            97% parameters and 92% FLOPs on ResNet18 CIFAR10 with no accuracy loss, and
                            achieve 44% reduction in run-time memory consumption and a 53% reduction in
                            inference latency.

                            The Internet, at large, remains under the control of service providers and
                            autonomous systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing provide an
                            increasing demand and potential for more user control for their web service
                            workflows. Network Softwarization revolutionizes the network landscape in
                            various stages, from building, incrementally deploying, and maintaining the
                            environment. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions
                            Virtualization (NFV) are two core tenets of network softwarization. SDN offers
                            a logically centralized control plane by abstracting away the control of the
                            network devices in the data plane. NFV virtualizes dedicated hardware
                            middleboxes and deploys them on top of servers and data centers as network
                            functions. Thus, network softwarization enables efficient management of the
                            system by enhancing its control and improving the reusability of the network
                            services. In this work, we propose our vision for a Software-Defined Internet
                            (SDI) for latency-sensitive web service workflows. SDI extends network
                            softwarization to the Internet-scale, to enable a latency-aware user workflow
                            execution on the Internet.

                            A framework is presented for handling a potential loss of observability of a
                            dynamical system in a provably-safe way. Inspired by the fragility of
                            data-driven perception systems used by autonomous vehicles, we formulate the
                            problem that arises when a sensing modality fails or is found to be
                            untrustworthy during autonomous operation. We cast this problem as a
                            differential game played between the dynamical system being controlled and the
                            external system factor(s) for which observations are lost. The game is a
                            zero-sum Stackelberg game in which the controlled system (leader) is trying to
                            find a trajectory which maximizes a function representing the safety of the
                            system, and the unobserved factor (follower) is trying to minimize the same
                            function. The set of winning initial configurations of this game for the
                            controlled system represent the set of all states in which safety can be
                            maintained with respect to the external factor, even if observability of that
                            factor is lost. This is the set we refer to as the Eyes-Closed Safety Kernel.
                            In practical use, the policy defined by the winning strategy of the controlled
                            system is only needed to be executed whenever observability of the external
                            system is lost or the system deviates from the Eyes-Closed Safety Kernel due to
                            other, non-safety oriented control schemes. We present a means for solving this
                            game offline, such that the resulting winning strategy can be used for
                            computationally efficient, provably-safe, online control when needed. The
                            solution approach presented is based on representing the game using the
                            solutions of two Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations. We illustrate
                            the applicability of our framework by working through a realistic example in
                            which an autonomous car must avoid a dynamic obstacle despite potentially
                            losing observability.

                            industrial applications is accompanied by several security concerns. A major
                            security concern is their probable abuse by adversaries towards their malicious
                            intent. Understanding and analyzing IoT malicious behaviors is crucial,
                            especially with their rapid growth and adoption in wide-range of applications.
                            However, recent studies have shown that machine learning-based approaches are
                            susceptible to adversarial attacks by adding junk codes to the binaries, for
                            example, with an intention to fool those machine learning or deep
                            learning-based detection systems. Realizing the importance of addressing this
                            challenge, this study proposes a malware detection system that is robust to
                            adversarial attacks. To do so, examine the performance of the state-of-the-art
                            methods against adversarial IoT software crafted using the graph embedding and
                            augmentation techniques. In particular, we study the robustness of such methods
                            against two black-box adversarial methods, GEA and SGEA, to generate
                            Adversarial Examples (AEs) with reduced overhead, and keeping their
                            practicality intact. Our comprehensive experimentation with GEA-based AEs show
                            the relation between misclassification and the graph size of the injected
                            sample. Upon optimization and with small perturbation, by use of SGEA, all the
                            IoT malware samples are misclassified as benign. This highlights the
                            vulnerability of current detection systems under adversarial settings. With the
                            landscape of possible adversarial attacks, we then propose DL-FHMC, a
                            fine-grained hierarchical learning approach for malware detection and
                            classification, that is robust to AEs with a capability to detect 88.52% of the
                            malicious AEs.

                            The advent of Industrial IoT (IIoT) along with Cloud computing has brought a
                            huge paradigm shift in manufacturing industries resulting in yet another
                            industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. Huge amounts of delay-sensitive data of
                            diverse nature are being generated which needs to be locally processed and
                            secured due to its sensitivity. But, the low-end IoT devices are unable to
                            handle huge computational overheads. Also, the semi-trusted nature of Cloud
                            introduces several security concerns. To address these issues, this work
                            proposes a secure Fog-based IIoT architecture by suitably plugging a number of
                            security features into it and by offloading some of the tasks judiciously to
                            fog nodes. These features secure the system alongside reducing the trust and
                            burden on the cloud and resource-constrained devices respectively. We validate
                            our proposed architecture through both theoretical overhead analysis and
                            practical experimentation including simulation study and testbed
                            implementation.

                            Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
                            Processing, concerned with identifying spans of text expressing references to
                            entities. NER research is often focused on flat entities only (flat NER),
                            ignoring the fact that entity references can be nested, as in [Bank of [China]]
                            (Finkel and Manning, 2009). In this paper, we use ideas from graph-based
                            dependency parsing to provide our model a global view on the input via a
                            biaffine model (Dozat and Manning, 2017). The biaffine model scores pairs of
                            start and end tokens in a sentence which we use to explore all spans, so that
                            the model is able to predict named entities accurately. We show that the model
                            works well for both nested and flat NER through evaluation on 8 corpora and
                            achieving SoTA performance on all of them, with accuracy gains of up to 2.2
                            percentage points.

                            Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted increasing attention due to
                            its strong adaptability to dynamic circumstances and potential for broad
                            applications such as autonomous and anonymous surveillance. With the help of
                            deep learning techniques, it has also witnessed substantial progress and
                            currently achieved around 90\% accuracy in benign environment. On the other
                            hand, research on the vulnerability of skeleton-based action recognition under
                            different adversarial settings remains scant, which may raise security concerns
                            about deploying such techniques into real-world systems. However, filling this
                            research gap is challenging due to the unique physical constraints of skeletons
                            and human actions. In this paper, we attempt to conduct a thorough study
                            towards understanding the adversarial vulnerability of skeleton-based action
                            recognition. We first formulate generation of adversarial skeleton actions as a
                            constrained optimization problem by representing or approximating the
                            physiological and physical constraints with mathematical formulations. Since
                            the primal optimization problem with equality constraints is intractable, we
                            propose to solve it by optimizing its unconstrained dual problem using ADMM. We
                            then specify an efficient plug-in defense, inspired by recent theories and
                            empirical observations, against the adversarial skeleton actions. Extensive
                            evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack and defense method
                            under different settings.

                            Advances in intelligent game playing agents have led to successes in perfect
                            information games like Go and imperfect information games like Poker. The
                            Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS) family of algorithms
                            outperforms previous algorithms using Monte Carlo methods in imperfect

                            Tree Search (SO-ISMCTS) is applied to Secret Hitler, a popular social deduction
                            board game that combines traditional hidden role mechanics with the randomness
                            of a card deck. This combination leads to a more complex information model than
                            the hidden role and card deck mechanics alone. It is shown in 10108 simulated
                            games that SO-ISMCTS plays as well as simpler rule based agents, and
                            demonstrates the potential of ISMCTS algorithms in complicated information set

                            detection scheme to interfere the validity of estimated states. In this paper,
                            we use an autoencoder neural network to detect anomalous system states and
                            investigate the impact of hyperparameters on the detection performance for
                            false data injection attacks that target power flows. Experimental results on
                            the IEEE 118 bus system indicate that the proposed mechanism has the ability to
                            achieve satisfactory learning efficiency and detection accuracy.

                            We introduce SAW, a tool for safety analysis of weakly-hard systems, in which
                            traditional hard timing constraints are relaxed to allow bounded deadline
                            misses for improving design flexibility and runtime resiliency. Safety
                            verification is a key issue for weakly-hard systems, as it ensures system
                            safety under allowed deadline misses. Previous works are either for linear
                            systems only, or limited to a certain type of nonlinear systems (e.g., systems
                            that satisfy exponential stability and Lipschitz continuity of the system
                            dynamics). In this work, we propose a new technique for infinite-time safety
                            verification of general nonlinear weakly-hard systems. Our approach first
                            discretizes the safe state set into grids and constructs a directed graph,
                            where nodes represent the grids and edges represent the reachability relation.
                            Based on graph theory and dynamic programming, our approach can effectively
                            find the safe initial set (consisting of a set of grids), from which the system
                            can be proven safe under given weakly-hard constraints. Experimental results
                            demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, when compared with the
                            state-of-the-art. An open source implementation of our tool is available at
                            https://github.com/551100kk/SAW. The virtual machine where the tool is ready to
                            run can be found at https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r08922054/SAW.ova.

                            Authorization and access control play an essential role in protecting
                            sensitive information from malicious users. The system is based on security
                            policies to determine if an access request is allowed. However, of late, the
                            growing popularity of big data has created a new challenge which the security
                            policy management is facing with such as dynamic and update policies in run
                            time. Applications of dynamic policies have brought many benefits to modern
                            domains. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies focusing
                            on solving authorization problems in the dynamic policy environments. In this
                            article, we focus on analyzing and classifying when an update policy occurs,
                            and provide a pragmatic solution for such dynamic policies. The contribution of
                            this work is twofold: a novel solution for managing the policy changes even
                            when the access request has been granted, and an XACML-based implementation to
                            empirically evaluate the proposed solution. The experimental results show the
                            comparison between the newly introduced XACs-DyPol framework with Balana (an
                            open source framework supporting XACML 3.0). The datasets are XACML 3.0-based
                            policies, including three samples of real-world policy sets. According to the
                            comparison results, our XACs-DyPol framework performs better than Balana in
                            terms of all updates in dynamic security policy cases. Specially, our proposed
                            solution outperforms by an order of magnitude when the policy structure
                            includes complex policy sets, policies, and rules or some complicated
                            comparison expression which contains higher than function and less than
                            function.

                            Sequence labeling systems should perform reliably not only under ideal
                            conditions but also with corrupted inputs - as these systems often process
                            user-generated text or follow an error-prone upstream component. To this end,
                            we formulate the noisy sequence labeling problem, where the input may undergo
                            an unknown noising process and propose two Noise-Aware Training (NAT)
                            objectives that improve robustness of sequence labeling performed on perturbed
                            input: Our data augmentation method trains a neural model using a mixture of
                            clean and noisy samples, whereas our stability training algorithm encourages
                            the model to create a noise-invariant latent representation. We employ a
                            vanilla noise model at training time. For evaluation, we use both the original
                            data and its variants perturbed with real OCR errors and misspellings.
                            Extensive experiments on English and German named entity recognition benchmarks
                            confirmed that NAT consistently improved robustness of popular sequence
                            labeling models, preserving accuracy on the original input. We make our code
                            and data publicly available for the research community.

                            Ambient backscatter communications (AmBackComs) have been recognized as a
                            spectrum- and energy-efficient technology for Internet of Things, as it allows
                            passive backscatter devices (BDs) to modulate their information into the legacy
                            signals, e.g., cellular signals, and reflect them to their associated receivers
                            while harvesting energy from the legacy signals to power their circuit
                            operation. {\color{black} However, the co-channel interference between the
                            backscatter link and the legacy link and the non-linear behavior of energy
                            harvesters at the BDs have largely been ignored in the performance analysis of
                            AmBackComs. Taking these two aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive
                            outage performance analysis for an AmBackCom system with multiple backscatter
                            links}, where one of the backscatter links is opportunistically selected to
                            leverage the legacy signals transmitted in a given resource block. For any
                            selected backscatter link, we propose an adaptive reflection coefficient (RC),
                            which is adapted to the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and the
                            location of the selected backscatter link, to minimize the outage probability
                            of the backscatter link. In order to study the impact of co-channel
                            interference on both backscatter and legacy links, for a selected backscatter
                            link, we derive the outage probabilities for the legacy link and the
                            backscatter link. Furthermore, we study the best and worst outage performances
                            for the backscatter system where the selected backscatter link maximizes or
                            minimizes the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) at the backscatter
                            receiver. We also study the best and worst outage performances for the legacy
                            link where the selected backscatter link results in the lowest and highest
                            co-channel interference to the legacy receiver, respectively.

                            This paper presents a class of novel high-order accurate discontinuous
                            Galerkin (DG) schemes for the compressible Euler equations under gravitational
                            fields. A notable feature of these schemes is that they are well-balanced for a
                            general hydrostatic equilibrium state, and at the same time, provably preserve
                            the positivity of density and pressure. In order to achieve the well-balanced
                            and positivity-preserving properties simultaneously, a novel DG spatial
                            discretization is carefully designed with suitable source term reformulation
                            and a properly modified Harten-Lax-van Leer contact (HLLC) flux. Based on some
                            technical decompositions as well as several key properties of the admissible
                            states and HLLC flux, rigorous positivity-preserving analyses are carried out.
                            It is proven that the resulting well-balanced DG schemes, coupled with strong
                            stability preserving time discretizations, satisfy a weak positivity property,
                            which implies that one can apply a simple existing limiter to effectively
                            enforce the positivity-preserving property, without losing high-order accuracy
                            and conservation. The proposed methods and analyses are applicable to the Euler
                            system with general equation of state. Extensive one- and two-dimensional
                            numerical tests demonstrate the desired properties of these schemes, including
                            the exact preservation of the equilibrium state, the ability to capture small
                            perturbation of such state, the robustness for solving problems involving low
                            density and/or low pressure, and good resolution for smooth and discontinuous
                            solutions.

                            We demonstrate a unified approach to rigorous design of safety-critical
                            autonomous systems using the VerifAI toolkit for formal analysis of AI-based
                            systems. VerifAI provides an integrated toolchain for tasks spanning the design
                            process, including modeling, falsification, debugging, and ML component
                            retraining. We evaluate all of these applications in an industrial case study
                            on an experimental autonomous aircraft taxiing system developed by Boeing,
                            which uses a neural network to track the centerline of a runway. We define
                            runway scenarios using the Scenic probabilistic programming language, and use
                            them to drive tests in the X-Plane flight simulator. We first perform
                            falsification, automatically finding environment conditions causing the system
                            to violate its specification by deviating significantly from the centerline (or
                            even leaving the runway entirely). Next, we use counterexample analysis to
                            identify distinct failure cases, and confirm their root causes with specialized
                            testing. Finally, we use the results of falsification and debugging to retrain
                            the network, eliminating several failure cases and improving the overall
                            performance of the closed-loop system.

                            The inability to correctly resolve rumours circulating online can have
                            harmful real-world consequences. We present a method for incorporating model
                            and data uncertainty estimates into natural language processing models for
                            automatic rumour verification. We show that these estimates can be used to
                            filter out model predictions likely to be erroneous, so that these difficult
                            instances can be prioritised by a human fact-checker. We propose two methods
                            for uncertainty-based instance rejection, supervised and unsupervised. We also
                            show how uncertainty estimates can be used to interpret model performance as a
                            rumour unfolds.

                            Distributed implementations of gradient-based methods, wherein a server
                            distributes gradient computations across worker machines, need to overcome two
                            limitations: delays caused by slow running machines called 'stragglers', and
                            communication overheads. Recently, Ye and Abbe [ICML 2018] proposed a
                            coding-theoretic paradigm to characterize a fundamental trade-off between
                            computation load per worker, communication overhead per worker, and straggler
                            tolerance. However, their proposed coding schemes suffer from heavy decoding
                            complexity and poor numerical stability. In this paper, we develop a
                            communication-efficient gradient coding framework to overcome these drawbacks.
                            Our proposed framework enables using any linear code to design the encoding and
                            decoding functions. When a particular code is used in this framework, its
                            block-length determines the computation load, dimension determines the
                            communication overhead, and minimum distance determines the straggler
                            tolerance. The flexibility of choosing a code allows us to gracefully trade-off
                            the straggler threshold and communication overhead for smaller decoding
                            complexity and higher numerical stability. Further, we show that using a
                            maximum distance separable (MDS) code generated by a random Gaussian matrix in
                            our framework yields a gradient code that is optimal with respect to the
                            trade-off and, in addition, satisfies stronger guarantees on numerical
                            stability as compared to the previously proposed schemes. Finally, we evaluate
                            our proposed framework on Amazon EC2 and demonstrate that it reduces the
                            average iteration time by 16% as compared to prior gradient coding schemes.

                            Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) demonstrate promising success in improving
                            the robustness and uncertainty quantification of modern deep learning. However,
                            they generally struggle with underfitting at scale and parameter efficiency. On
                            the other hand, deep ensembles have emerged as alternatives for uncertainty
                            quantification that, while outperforming BNNs on certain problems, also suffer
                            from efficiency issues. It remains unclear how to combine the strengths of
                            these two approaches and remediate their common issues. To tackle this
                            challenge, we propose a rank-1 parameterization of BNNs, where each weight
                            matrix involves only a distribution on a rank-1 subspace. We also revisit the
                            use of mixture approximate posteriors to capture multiple modes, where unlike
                            typical mixtures, this approach admits a significantly smaller memory increase
                            (e.g., only a 0.4% increase for a ResNet-50 mixture of size 10). We perform a
                            systematic empirical study on the choices of prior, variational posterior, and
                            methods to improve training. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, Wide ResNet 28-10 on
                            CIFAR-10/100, and an RNN on MIMIC-III, rank-1 BNNs achieve state-of-the-art
                            performance across log-likelihood, accuracy, and calibration on the test sets
                            and out-of-distribution variants.

                            Industrial applications involving formal methods are still exceptions to the
                            general rule. Lack of understanding, employees without proper education,
                            difficulty to integrate existing development cycles, no explicit requirement
                            from the market, etc. are explanations often heard for not being more formal.
                            Hence the feedback provided by industry to academics is not as constructive as
                            it might be. Summarizing a 25-year return of experience in the effective
                            application of a formal method - namely B and Event-B - in diverse application
                            domains (railways, smartcard, automotive), this article makes clear why and
                            where formal methods have been applied, explains the added value obtained so
                            far, and tries to anticipate the future of these two formalisms for safety
                            critical systems.

                            Developing safety critical applications often require rare human resources to
                            complete successfully while off-the-shelf block solutions appear difficult to
                            adapt especially during short-term projects. The CLEARSY Safety Platform
                            fulfils a need for a technical solution to overcome the difficulties to develop
                            SIL3/SIL4 system with its technology based on a double-processor and a formal
                            method with proof to ensure safety at the highest level. The formal method,
                            namely the B method, has been heavily used in the railways industry for
                            decades. Using its IDE, Atelier B, to program the CLEARSY Safety Platform
                            ensures a higherlevel of confidence on the software generated. This paper
                            presents this platform aimed at revolutionising the development of safety
                            critical systems, developed through the FUI project LCHIP (Low Cost High

                            Grover's Search algorithm was a breakthrough at the time it was introduced,
                            and its underlying procedure of amplitude amplification has been a building
                            block of many other algorithms and patterns for extracting information encoded
                            in quantum states. In this paper, we introduce an optimization of the
                            inversion-by-the-mean step of the algorithm. This optimization serves two
                            purposes: from a practical perspective, it can lead to a performance
                            improvement; from a theoretical one, it leads to a novel interpretation of the
                            actual nature of this step. Specifically, we illustrate how this step is a
                            reflection, which is realized by (a) cancelling the superposition of a general
                            state to revert to the original all-zeros state, (b) flipping the sign of the
                            amplitude of the all-zeros state, and finally (c) reverting back to the
                            superposition state. Rather than canceling the superposition, our approach
                            allows for going forward to another state that makes the reflection easier. We
                            validate our approach on set and array search, and confirm our results
                            experimentally on real quantum hardware.

                            Recently deep generative models have achieved impressive progress in modeling
                            the distribution of training data. In this work, we present for the first time
                            generative models for 4D light field patches using variational autoencoders to
                            capture the data distribution of light field patches. We develop two generative
                            models, a model conditioned on the central view of the light field and an
                            unconditional model. We incorporate our generative priors in an energy
                            minimization framework to address diverse light field reconstruction tasks.
                            While pure learning-based approaches do achieve excellent results on each
                            instance of such a problem, their applicability is limited to the specific
                            observation model they have been trained on. On the contrary, our trained light
                            field generative models can be incorporated as a prior into any model-based
                            optimization approach and therefore extend to diverse reconstruction tasks
                            including light field view synthesis, spatial-angular super resolution and
                            reconstruction from coded projections. Our proposed method demonstrates good
                            reconstruction, with performance approaching end-to-end trained networks, while
                            outperforming traditional model-based approaches on both synthetic and real
                            scenes. Furthermore, we show that our approach enables reliable light field
                            recovery despite distortions in the input.

                            Melanoma is a life-threatening form of skin cancer when left undiagnosed at
                            the early stages. Although there are more cases of non-melanoma cancer than
                            melanoma cancer, melanoma cancer is more deadly. Early detection of melanoma is
                            crucial for the timely diagnosis of melanoma cancer and prohibit its spread to
                            distant body parts. Segmentation of skin lesion is a crucial step in the
                            classification of melanoma cancer from the cancerous lesions in dermoscopic
                            images. Manual segmentation of dermoscopic skin images is very time consuming
                            and error-prone resulting in an urgent need for an intelligent and accurate
                            algorithm. In this study, we propose a simple yet novel network-in-network
                            convolution neural network(CNN) based approach for segmentation of the skin
                            lesion. A Faster Region-based CNN (Faster RCNN) is used for preprocessing to
                            predict bounding boxes of the lesions in the whole image which are subsequently
                            cropped and fed into the segmentation network to obtain the lesion mask. The
                            segmentation network is a combination of the UNet and Hourglass networks. We
                            trained and evaluated our models on ISIC 2018 dataset and also cross-validated
                            on PH\textsuperscript{2} and ISBI 2017 datasets. Our proposed method surpassed
                            the state-of-the-art with Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.915 and Accuracy
                            0.959 on ISIC 2018 dataset and Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.947 and
                            Accuracy 0.971 on ISBI 2017 dataset.

                            Phylogenomics is a new field which applies to tools in phylogenetics to

                            challenges to analyze them over a space of phylogenetic trees. Because a space
                            of phylogenetic trees with a fixed set of labels on leaves is not Euclidean, we

                            Forecasting the weather is an increasingly data intensive exercise. Numerical
                            Weather Prediction (NWP) models are becoming more complex, with higher
                            resolutions, and there are increasing numbers of different models in operation
                            around the world. While the forecasting skill of NWP models continues to
                            improve, the number and complexity of these models poses a new challenge for
                            the operational meteorologist: how should the information from all available
                            models, each with their own unique biases and limitations, be combined in order
                            to provide stakeholders with well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts to use in
                            decision making?
                            <br />In this paper, we use a road surface temperature forecasting example to
                            demonstrate a three-stage framework that uses machine learning to bridge the
                            gap between sets of separate forecasts from NWP models and the 'ideal' forecast
                            for decision support: probabilities of future weather outcomes. First, we use
                            Quantile Regression Forests to learn the error profile of each numerical model,
                            and use these to apply empirically-derived probability distributions to
                            forecasts. Second, we combine these probabilistic forecasts using quantile
                            averaging. Third, we interpolate between the aggregate quantiles in order to
                            generate a full predictive distribution, which we demonstrate has properties
                            suitable for decision support. Our results suggest that this three stage
                            approach provides an effective and operationally viable framework for the
                            cohesive post-processing of weather forecasts across multiple models and lead
                            times in order to produce well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts.

                            Inspired by applications in testing for COVID-19, we consider a variant of
                            two-stage group testing we call "conservative" two-stage testing, where every
                            item declared to be defective must be definitively confirmed by being tested by
                            itself in the second stage. We study this in the linear regime where the
                            prevalence is fixed while the number of items is large. We study various
                            nonadaptive test designs for the first stage, and derive a new lower bound for
                            the total number of tests required. We find that a first-stage design with

                            A graph game is a two-player zero-sum game in which the players move a token
                            throughout a graph to produce an infinite path, which determines the winner or
                            payoff of the game. In "bidding games", in each turn, we hold an 'auction'
                            (bidding) to determine which player moves the token. The players simultaneously
                            submit bids and the higher bidder moves the token. Several different payment
                            schemes have been considered. In "first-price" bidding, only the higher bidder
                            pays his bid, while in "all-pay" bidding, both players pay their bids. Bidding
                            games were largely studied with variants of first-price bidding. In this work,
                            we study, for the first time, infinite-duration all-pay bidding games, and show
                            that they exhibit the elegant mathematical properties of their first-price
                            counterparts. This is in stark contrast with reachability games, which are
                            known to be much more complicated under all-pay bidding than first-price
                            bidding. Another orthogonal distinction between the bidding rules is in the
                            recipient of the payments: in "Richman" bidding, the bids are paid to the other
                            player, and in "poorman" bidding, the bids are paid to the 'bank'. We focus on
                            strongly-connected games with "mean-payoff" and "parity" objectives. We
                            completely solve all-pay Richman games: a simple argument shows that
                            deterministic strategies cannot guarantee anything in this model, and it is
                            technically much more challenging to find optimal probabilistic strategies that
                            achieve the same expected guarantees in a game as can be obtained with
                            deterministic strategies under first-price bidding. Under poorman all-pay
                            bidding, in contrast to Richman bidding, deterministic strategies are useful
                            and guarantee a payoff that is only slightly lower than the optimal payoff
                            under first-price poorman bidding. Our proofs are constructive and based on new
                            and significantly simpler constructions for first-price bidding.

                            In this paper we investigate the importance of the extent of memory in
                            sequential self attention for sound recognition. We propose to use a memory
                            controlled sequential self attention mechanism on top of a convolutional
                            recurrent neural network (CRNN) model for polyphonic sound event detection
                            (SED). Experiments on the URBAN-SED dataset demonstrate the impact of the
                            extent of memory on sound recognition performance with the self attention
                            induced SED model. We extend the proposed idea with a multi-head self attention
                            mechanism where each attention head processes the audio embedding with explicit
                            attention width values. The proposed use of memory controlled sequential self
                            attention offers a way to induce relations among frames of sound event tokens.
                            We show that our memory controlled self attention model achieves an event based
                            F -score of 33.92% on the URBAN-SED dataset, outperforming the F -score of
                            20.10% reported by the model without self attention.

                            We are facing a common serious issue, infectious diseases, and trying to
                            suppress the spreading of infection. We need less contact with each other to
                            decrease the chance of infection, but this means loss of economic activity, as
                            well. This tradeoff is inevitable in our society, because we still need direct
                            communication and commuting, so far. The focus of our paper is the structure of
                            society, on which we have direct contacts. We study on spreading process with
                            artificial sosiety model, where each agent has daily cycle and go office and
                            back home, every day. At the same time, infection spreads along SIR model. We
                            show both slow infection and short commuting can be realized with some
                            structures and vice versa. The most effective factor for such features is
                            modularity of society. In highly modular society, agents live around the
                            destined office, but agents commute long way to their office and can be
                            infected fast, in not modular society. The first infection point is one more
                            factor for the features. If the first infection takes place around the office,
                            infection spreads slower. On the contrary, if the first one takes place far
                            away from the office, infection can be fast. We show a design principle, high
                            modularity and sparsely distributed offices, for good society and discuss on
                            possible solutions in real society, where we live in.

                            We present an overlapping Schwarz decomposition algorithm for solving
                            nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs). Our approach decomposes the time
                            domain into a set of overlapping subdomains and solves subproblems defined over
                            such subdomains in parallel. Convergence is attained by updating primal-dual
                            information at the boundaries of the overlapping regions. We show that the
                            algorithm exhibits local convergence and that the convergence rate improves
                            exponentially with the size of the overlap. Our convergence results rely on a
                            sensitivity result for OCPs that we call "asymptotic decay of sensitivity."
                            Intuitively, this result states that impact of parametric perturbations at the
                            boundaries of the time domain (initial and final time) decays exponentially as
                            one moves away from the perturbation points. We show that this condition holds
                            for nonlinear OCPs under a uniform second-order sufficient condition, a
                            controllability condition, and a uniform boundedness condition. The approach is
                            demonstrated by using a highly nonlinear quadrotor motion planning problem.

                            Deep Neural Networks are increasingly used in video frame interpolation tasks
                            such as frame rate changes as well as generating fake face videos. Our project
                            aims to apply recent advances in Deep video interpolation to increase the
                            temporal resolution of fluorescent microscopy time-lapse movies. To our
                            knowledge, there is no previous work that uses Convolutional Neural Networks
                            (CNN) to generate frames between two consecutive microscopy images. We propose
                            a fully convolutional autoencoder network that takes as input two images and
                            generates upto seven intermediate images. Our architecture has two encoders
                            each with a skip connection to a single decoder. We evaluate the performance of
                            several variants of our model that differ in network architecture and loss
                            function. Our best model out-performs state of the art video frame
                            interpolation algorithms. We also show qualitative and quantitative comparisons
                            with state-of-the-art video frame interpolation algorithms. We believe deep
                            video interpolation represents a new approach to improve the time-resolution of
                            fluorescent microscopy.

                            In this work we explore the latency and accuracy of keyword spotting (KWS)
                            models in streaming and non-streaming modes on mobile phones. NN model
                            conversion from non-streaming mode (model receives the whole input sequence and
                            then returns the classification result) to streaming mode (model receives
                            portion of the input sequence and classifies it incrementally) may require
                            manual model rewriting. We address this by designing a Tensorflow/Keras based
                            library which allows automatic conversion of non-streaming models to streaming
                            ones with minimum effort. With this library we benchmark multiple KWS models in

                            different tradeoffs between latency and accuracy. We also explore novel KWS
                            models with multi-head attention which reduce the classification error over the

                            Although humans perform well at predicting what exists beyond the boundaries
                            of an image, deep models struggle to understand context and extrapolation
                            through retained information. This task is known as image outpainting and
                            involves generating realistic expansions of an image's boundaries. Current
                            models use generative adversarial networks to generate results which lack
                            localized image feature consistency and appear fake. We propose two methods to
                            improve this issue: the use of a local and global discriminator, and the
                            addition of residual blocks within the encoding section of the network.
                            Comparisons of our model and the baseline's L1 loss, mean squared error (MSE)
                            loss, and qualitative differences reveal our model is able to naturally extend
                            object boundaries and produce more internally consistent images compared to
                            current methods but produces lower fidelity images.

                            Deep neural networks have a great potential to improve image denoising in
                            low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). Popular ways to increase the network
                            capacity include adding more layers or repeating a modularized clone model in a
                            sequence. In such sequential architectures, the noisy input image and end
                            output image are commonly used only once in the training model, which however
                            limits the overall learning performance. In this paper, we propose a
                            parallel-clone neural network method that utilizes a modularized network model
                            and exploits the benefit of parallel input, parallel-output loss, and
                            clone-toclone feature transfer. The proposed model keeps a similar or less
                            number of unknown network weights as compared to conventional models but can
                            accelerate the learning process significantly. The method was evaluated using
                            the Mayo LDCT dataset and compared with existing deep learning models. The
                            results show that the use of parallel input, parallel-output loss, and
                            clone-to-clone feature transfer all can contribute to an accelerated
                            convergence of deep learning and lead to improved image quality in testing. The
                            parallel-clone network has been demonstrated promising for LDCT image
                            denoising.

                            Autonomous driving is an important trend of the automotive industry. The
                            continuous research towards this goal requires a precise reference vehicle
                            state estimation under all circumstances in order to develop and test
                            autonomous vehicle functions. However, even when lane-accurate positioning is
                            expected from oncoming technologies, like the L5 GPS band, the question of
                            accurate positioning in roofed areas, e.\,g., tunnels or park houses, still has
                            to be addressed.
                            <br />In this paper, a novel procedure for a reference vehicle state estimation is
                            presented. The procedure includes three main components. First, a robust

                            Second, a vehicle state estimation by means of statistical filtering. Third, a
                            high accuracy LiDAR-based positioning method that delivers velocity, position
                            and orientation correction data with a mean error of 0.1 m/s, 4.7 cm and
                            1$^\circ$ respectively. Runtime tests on a CPU indicates the possibility of
                            real-time implementation.

                            This paper investigates a class of unified stochastic linear quadratic
                            Gaussian (LQG) social optima problems involving a large number of
                            weakly-coupled interactive agents under a {generalized} setting. For each
                            individual agent, the control and state process enters both diffusion and drift
                            terms in its linear dynamics, and the control weight might be \emph{indefinite}
                            in cost functional. This setup is {innovative and has great theoretical and
                            realistic significance} as its applications in mathematical finance {(e.g.,
                            portfolio selection in mean-variation model)}. Using some \emph{fully-coupled}
                            variational analysis under person-by-person optimality principle, and
                            mean-field approximation method, the decentralized social control is derived by
                            a class of new type consistency condition (CC) system for typical
                            representative agent. Such CC system is some mean-field forward-backward
                            stochastic differential equation (MF-FBSDE) combined with \emph{embedding

                            differential equation (FBSDE) system is carefully examined. The related social
                            asymptotic optimality is related to the convergence of the average of a series
                            of weakly-coupled backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). They are
                            verified through some Lyapunov equations.

                            The trend towards autonomous driving and the continuous research in the
                            automotive area, like Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), requires an
                            accurate localization under all circumstances. An accurate estimation of the
                            vehicle state is a basic requirement for any trajectory-planning algorithm.
                            Still, even when the introduction of the GPS L5 band promises lane-accuracy,
                            coverage limitations in roofed areas still have to be addressed. In this work,
                            a method for high precision indoor positioning using a LiDAR is presented. The
                            method is based on the combination of motion models with LiDAR measurements,
                            and uses infrastructural elements as positioning references. This allows to
                            estimate the orientation, velocity over ground and position of a vehicle in a
                            Local Tangent Plane (LTP) reference frame. When the outputs of the proposed
                            method are compared to those of an Automotive Dynamic Motion Analyzer (ADMA),
                            mean errors of 1 degree, 0.1 m/s and of 4.7 cm respectively are obtained. The
                            method can be implemented by using a LiDAR sensor as a stand-alone unit. A
                            median runtime of 40.77 us on an Intel i7-6820HQ CPU signals the possibility of
                            real-time processing.

                            especially when a large amount of data is involved. An automated and reliable
                            quality control (QC) is thus mandatory. Moreover, the computation time of the
                            QC must be also compatible with the processing of massive datasets. Therefore,
                            deep neural network approaches appear as a method of choice to automatically
                            assess registration quality. In the current study, a compact 3D CNN, referred
                            to as RegQCNET, is introduced to quantitatively predict the amplitude of a
                            registration mismatch between the registered image and the reference template.
                            This quantitative estimation of registration error is expressed using metric
                            unit system. Therefore, a meaningful task-specific threshold can be manually or
                            automatically defined in order to distinguish usable and non-usable images. The
                            robustness of the proposed RegQCNET is first analyzed on lifespan brain images
                            undergoing various simulated spatial transformations and intensity variations
                            between training and testing. Secondly, the potential of RegQCNET to classify
                            images as usable or non-usable is evaluated using both manual and automatic
                            thresholds. The latters were estimated using several computer-assisted
                            classification models through cross-validation. To this end we used expert's
                            visual quality control estimated on a lifespan cohort of 3953 brains. Finally,
                            the RegQCNET accuracy is compared to usual image features such as image
                            correlation coefficient and mutual information. Results show that the proposed
                            deep learning QC is robust, fast and accurate to estimate registration error in
                            processing pipeline.

                            We provide lower bounds for the estimation of the eigenspaces of a covariance
                            operator. These information inequalities are non-asymptotic and can be applied

                            The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most extensively employed signals
                            used in the diagnosis and prediction of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The ECG
                            signals can capture the heart's rhythmic irregularities, commonly known as
                            arrhythmias. A careful study of ECG signals is crucial for precise diagnoses of
                            patients' acute and chronic heart conditions. In this study, we propose a
                            two-dimensional (2-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the
                            classification of ECG signals into eight classes; namely, normal beat,
                            premature ventricular contraction beat, paced beat, right bundle branch block
                            beat, left bundle branch block beat, atrial premature contraction beat,
                            ventricular flutter wave beat, and ventricular escape beat. The one-dimensional
                            ECG time series signals are transformed into 2-D spectrograms through
                            short-time Fourier transform. The 2-D CNN model consisting of four
                            convolutional layers and four pooling layers is designed for extracting robust
                            features from the input spectrograms. Our proposed methodology is evaluated on
                            a publicly available MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. We achieved a state-of-the-art
                            average classification accuracy of 99.11\%, which is better than those of
                            recently reported results in classifying similar types of arrhythmias. The
                            performance is significant in other indices as well, including sensitivity and
                            specificity, which indicates the success of the proposed method.

                            We consider the propagation of acoustic waves at a given wavenumber in a
                            waveguide which is unbounded in one direction. We explain how to construct
                            penetrable obstacles characterized by a physical coefficient $\rho$ which are
                            invisible in various ways. In particular, we focus our attention on
                            invisibility in reflection (the reflection matrix is zero), invisibility in
                            reflection and transmission (the scattering matrix is the same as if there were
                            no obstacle) and relative invisibility (two different obstacles have the same
                            scattering matrix). To study these problems, we use a continuation method which
                            requires to compute the scattering matrix $\mathbb{S}(\rho)$ as well as its
                            differential with respect to the material index $d\mathbb{S}(\rho)$. The
                            justification of the method also needs for the proof of abstract results of
                            ontoness of well-chosen functionals constructed from the terms of
                            $d\mathbb{S}(\rho)$. We provide a complete proof of the results in monomode
                            regime when the wavenumber is such that only one mode can propagate. And we
                            give all the ingredients to implement the method in multimode regime. We end
                            the article by presenting numerical results to illustrate the analysis.

                            Consonant gemination in Italian affricates and fricatives was investigated,
                            which completed the overall study of gemination of Italian consonants. Results
                            of the analysis of the other consonant categories, i.e. stops, nasals, and
                            liquids, had shown that closure duration for stops and consonant duration for
                            nasals and liquids, form the most salient acoustic cues to gemination.
                            Frequency and energy domain parameters were not significantly affected by
                            gemination in a systematic way in all consonant classes. Results on fricatives
                            and affricates confirmed the above findings, i.e., that the primary acoustic
                            correlate of gemination is durational in nature, and corresponds to a
                            lengthened consonant duration for fricative geminates and a lengthened closure
                            duration for affricate geminates. An inverse correlation between consonant and
                            pre-consonant vowel durations was present for both consonant categories, and
                            also for both singleton and geminate word sets when considered separately. This
                            effect was reinforced for combined sets, confirming the hypothesis that a
                            durational compensation between different phonemes may serve to preserve
                            rhythmical structures. Classification tests of single against geminate
                            consonants using the durational acoustic cues as classification parameters
                            confirmed their validity, and highlighted peculiarities of the two consonant
                            classes. In particular, a relatively poor classification performance was
                            observed for affricates, which led to refining the analysis by considering
                            dental vs. non-dental affricates in two different sets. Results support the
                            hypothesis that dental affricates, in Italian, may not appear in intervocalic
                            position as singletons but only in their geminate form.

                            All Italian consonants affected by gemination, that is affricates,
                            fricatives, liquids, nasals and stops were analysed within a project named
                            GEMMA that lasted over a span of about 25 years. Results of the analysis on
                            stops, as published in a previous paper, had shown that the main acoustic cue
                            to gemination in Italian is closure duration, while frequency and energy domain
                            parameters were not significantly affected by gemination. This paper - the
                            first of a set of two covering all remaining consonants - addresses nasals and
                            liquids; its companion paper addresses affricates and fricatives. Results on
                            nasals and liquids confirm the findings on stops, and reinforce the hypothesis
                            that the primary acoustic cue to gemination in Italian is durational in nature,
                            and corresponds to a lengthened consonant duration. Results also show an
                            inverse correlation between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations. This
                            correlation is, however, also present when considering singleton vs. geminate
                            word sets separately, indicating a sort of duration compensation between these
                            phonemes to eventually preserve rhythmical structures; this inverse correlation
                            is reinforced when considering singleton and geminate sets combined.
                            Classification tests of single vs. geminate consonants show that, for both
                            nasals and liquids, best classification scores are obtained using consonant
                            duration, that is a durational parameter. Although slightly less performing,
                            the ratio between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations is also a
                            potential good candidate for automatic classification of nasals and liquids
                            geminate vs singleton consonants in Italian.

                            Human perceptual and cognitive abilities are limited resources. Today, in the
                            age of cheap information --cheap to produce, to manipulate, to disseminate--,
                            this cognitive bottleneck translates into hypercompetition for visibility among
                            actors (individuals, institutions, etc). The same social communication
                            incentive --visibility-- pushes actors to mutualistically interact with
                            specific memes, seeking the virality of their messages. In turn, contents are
                            driven by selective pressure, i.e. the chances to persist and reach widely are
                            tightly subject to changes in the communication environment. In spite of all
                            this complexity, here we show that the underlying architecture of the
                            users-memes interaction in information ecosystems, apparently chaotic and
                            noisy, actually evolves towards emergent patterns, reminiscent of those found
                            in natural ecosystems. In particular we show, through the analysis of
                            empirical, large data streams, that communication networks are structurally
                            elastic, i.e. fluctuating from modular to nested architecture as a response to
                            environmental perturbations (e.g. extraordinary events). We then propose an
                            ecology-inspired modelling framework, bringing to light the precise mechanisms
                            causing the observed dynamical reorganisation. Finally, from numerical
                            simulations, the model predicts --and the data confirm-- that the users'
                            struggle for visibility induces a re-equilibration of the network towards a
                            very constrained organisation: the emergence of self-similar nested
                            arrangements.

                            Ambient sound scenes typically comprise multiple short events occurring on
                            top of a somewhat stationary background. We consider the task of separating
                            these events from the background, which we call foreground-background ambient
                            sound scene separation. We propose a deep learning-based separation framework
                            with a suitable feature normaliza-tion scheme and an optional auxiliary network
                            capturing the background statistics, and we investigate its ability to handle
                            the great variety of sound classes encountered in ambient sound scenes, which
                            have often not been seen in training. To do so, we create single-channel
                            foreground-background mixtures using isolated sounds from the DESED and
                            Audioset datasets, and we conduct extensive experiments with mixtures of seen
                            or unseen sound classes at various signal-to-noise ratios. Our experimental
                            findings demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed approach.

                            The transmission of infectious diseases depends on the social networks among
                            people and the protections that people have taken before being exposed to the
                            disease. Mass media is playing a key role in making the public aware of the
                            disease and its transmissibility and severity. Motivated by the importance of
                            heterogeneous risk perception in the population to response to infectious
                            disease outbreaks, we propose a heterogeneous three-layer network model, namely
                            the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Unaware-Aware-Protected (SEIR-UAP)
                            model, where people's vulnerability to the disease is influenced by the
                            processes of awareness information diffusion, preventive behavior change and
                            infectious disease transmission. We found that (a) the awareness of the disease
                            plays the central role in preventing disease outbreak; (b) we need a reasonable
                            ratio of "over-reacting" nodes to effectively control the disease outbreak; (c)
                            diseases with a longer incubation period and a higher recovery rate are easier
                            to control because the processes of information diffusion and behavior change
                            can help people prepare for the upcoming exposure to the disease; (d) it is
                            more difficult to control the disease with asymptomatic cases. The results
                            provide evidence that mass media should not play down the transmissibility and
                            severity of diseases, so that the public can become aware of the disease as
                            soon as possible.

                            Recently pretrained generative models have shown promising results for
                            subsampled Fourier Ptychography (FP) in terms of quality of reconstruction for
                            extremely low sampling rate and high noise. However, one of the significant
                            drawbacks of these pretrained generative priors is their limited representation
                            capabilities. Moreover, training these generative models requires access to a
                            large number of fully-observed clean samples of a particular class of images
                            like faces or digits that is prohibitive to obtain in the context of FP. In
                            this paper, we propose to leverage the power of pretrained invertible and
                            untrained generative models to mitigate the representation error issue and
                            requirement of a large number of example images (for training generative
                            models) respectively. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the

                            In previous works, only parameter weights of ASR models are optimized under
                            fixed-topology architecture. However, the design of successful model
                            architecture has always relied on human experience and intuition. Besides, many
                            hyperparameters related to model architecture need to be manually tuned.
                            Therefore in this paper, we propose an ASR approach with efficient
                            gradient-based architecture search, DARTS-ASR. In order to examine the
                            generalizability of DARTS-ASR, we apply our approach not only on many languages
                            to perform monolingual ASR, but also on a multilingual ASR setting. Following
                            previous works, we conducted experiments on a multilingual dataset, IARPA
                            BABEL. The experiment results show that our approach outperformed the baseline
                            fixed-topology architecture by 10.2% and 10.0% relative reduction on character
                            error rates under monolingual and multilingual ASR settings respectively.
                            Furthermore, we perform some analysis on the searched architectures by
                            DARTS-ASR.

                            In the domain of social signal processing, automated audio recognition is a
                            promising avenue for researchers interested in accessing daily behaviors that
                            can contribute to wellbeing and mental health outcomes. However, despite
                            remarkable advances in mobile computing and machine learning, audio behavior
                            detection models are largely constrained to data collected in controlled
                            settings such as labs or call centers. This is problematic as it means their
                            performance is unlikely to adequately generalize to real-world applications. In
                            the current paper, we present a model combining deep spectrum and acoustic
                            features to detect and classify infant distress vocalizations in real-world
                            data. To develop our model, we collected and annotated a large dataset of over
                            780 hours of real-world audio data via a wearable audio recorder worn by
                            infants for up to 24 hours in their natural home environments. Our model has F1
                            score of 0.597 relative to an F1 score of 0.166 achieved by real-world
                            state-of-practice infant distress classifiers and an F1 score of 0.26 achieved
                            by state-of-the-art, real-world infant distress classifiers published last year
                            in Interspeech's paralinguistic challenge. Impressively, it also achieves an F1
                            score within 0.1 of state-of-the-art infant distress classifiers developed and
                            tested using laboratory quality data.

                            F-systems are digraphs that enable to model sentences that predicate the
                            falsity of other sentences. Paradoxes like the Liar and Yablo's can be analyzed
                            with that tool to find graph-theoretic patterns. In this paper we present the
                            F-systems model abstracting from all the features of the language in which the
                            represented sentences are expressed. All that is assumed is the existence of
                            sentences and the binary relation '... affirms the falsity of ...' among them.
                            The possible existence of non-referential sentences is also considered. To
                            model the sets of all the sentences that can jointly be valued as true we
                            introduce the notion of conglomerate, the existence of which guarantees the
                            absence of paradox. Conglomerates also enable to characterize referential
                            contradictions, i.e. sentences that can only be false under a classical
                            valuation due to the interactions with other sentences in the model. A Kripke's
                            style fixed point characterization of groundedness is offered and fixed points
                            which are complete (meaning that every sentence is deemed either true or false)
                            and consistent (meaning that no sentence is deemed true and false) are put in
                            correspondence with conglomerates. Furthermore, argumentation frameworks are
                            special cases of F-systems. We show the relation between local conglomerates
                            and admissible sets of arguments and argue about the usefulness of the concept
                            for argumentation theory.

                            Timely failure detection for bearings is of great importance to prevent
                            economic loses in the industry. In this article we propose a method based on
                            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to estimate the level of wear in bearings.
                            First of all, an automatic labeling of the raw vibration data is performed to
                            obtain different levels of bearing wear, by means of the Root Mean Square
                            features along with the Shannon's entropy to extract features from the raw
                            data, which is then grouped in seven different classes using the K-means
                            algorithm to obtain the labels. Then, the raw vibration data is converted into
                            small square images, each sample of the data representing one pixel of the
                            image. Following this, we propose a CNN model based on the AlexNet architecture
                            to classify the wear level and diagnose the rotatory system. To train the
                            network and validate our proposal, we use a dataset from the center of
                            Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), and extensively compare it with other
                            methods reported in the literature. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy
                            proved to be excellent, outperforming other approaches in the state-of-the-art.

                            Flows through medical devices as well as in anatomical vessels despite being
                            at moderate Reynolds number may exhibit transitional or even turbulent
                            character. In order to validate numerical methods and codes used for biomedical
                            flow computations, the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) established an
                            experimental benchmark, which was a pipe with gradual contraction and sudden
                            expansion representing a nozzle. The experimental results for various Reynolds
                            numbers ranging from 500 to 6500 were publicly released. Previous and recent
                            computational investigations of flow in the FDA nozzle found limitations in
                            various CFD approaches and some even questioned the adequacy of the benchmark
                            itself. This communication reports the results of a lattice Boltzmann method
                            (LBM) based direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach applied to the FDA
                            nozzle benchmark for transitional cases of Reynolds numbers 2000 and 3500. The
                            goal is to evaluate if a simple off the shelf LBM would predict the
                            experimental results without the use of complex models or synthetic turbulence
                            at the inflow. LBM computations with various spatial and temporal resolutions
                            are performed - in the extremities of 44 million to 2.8 billion lattice cells -
                            conducted respectively on 32 CPU cores of a desktop to more than 300'000 cores

                            The novel Wuhan coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has brought almost
                            unprecedented effects for a non-wartime setting, hitting social, economic and
                            health systems hard.~ Being able to bring to bear pharmaceutical interventions
                            to counteract its effects will represent a major turning point in the fight to
                            turn the tides in this ongoing battle.~ Recently, the World's most powerful
                            supercomputer, SUMMIT, was used to identify existing small molecule
                            pharmaceuticals which may have the desired activity against SARS-CoV-2 through
                            a high throughput virtual screening approach. In this communication, we
                            demonstrate how the use of Bayesian optimization can provide a valuable service

                            Data fusion refers to the joint analysis of multiple datasets which provide
                            complementary views of the same task. In this preprint, the problem of jointly
                            analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance
                            Imaging (fMRI) data is considered. Jointly analyzing EEG and fMRI measurements
                            is highly beneficial for studying brain function because these modalities have
                            complementary spatiotemporal resolution: EEG offers good temporal resolution
                            while fMRI is better in its spatial resolution. The fusion methods reported so
                            far ignore the underlying multi-way nature of the data in at least one of the
                            modalities and/or rely on very strong assumptions about the relation of the two
                            datasets. In this preprint, these two points are addressed by adopting for the
                            first time tensor models in the two modalities while also exploring double
                            coupled tensor decompositions and by following soft and flexible coupling
                            approaches to implement the multi-modal analysis. To cope with the Event
                            Related Potential (ERP) variability in EEG, the PARAFAC2 model is adopted. The
                            results obtained are compared against those of parallel Independent Component
                            Analysis (ICA) and hard coupling alternatives in both simulated and real data.
                            Our results confirm the superiority of tensorial methods over methods based on
                            ICA. In scenarios that do not meet the assumptions underlying hard coupling,
                            the advantage of soft and flexible coupled decompositions is clearly
                            demonstrated.

                            Binary Neural Networks enable smart IoT devices, as they significantly reduce
                            the required memory footprint and computational complexity while retaining a
                            high network performance and flexibility. This paper presents ChewBaccaNN, a
                            0.7 mm$^2$ sized binary CNN accelerator designed in globalfoundries 22 nm
                            technology. By exploiting efficient data re-use, data buffering, latch-based
                            memories, and voltage scaling, a throughput of 233 GOPS is achieved while
                            consuming just 1.2 mW at 0.4V/154MHz for the inference of binary CNNs with 7x7
                            kernels, leading to a core energy efficiency of 223 TOPS/W. This is up to 4.4x
                            better than other specialized binary accelerators while supporting full
                            flexibility in kernel configurations. With as little as 3.9 mJ, using an 8-fold
                            ResNet-18, a Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet of 67.5% can be achieved, which is just
                            1.8% less than using the full-precision ResNet-18.

                            Very small electromechanical coupling coefficient in micro-electromechanical
                            systems (MEMS) or acoustic resonators is quite of a concern for oscillator
                            performance, specially at mmWave frequencies. This small coefficient is the
                            manifestation of the small ratio of motional capacitance to static capacitance
                            in the resonators. This work provides a general solution to overcome the

                            Current speaker verification techniques rely on a neural network to extract
                            speaker representations. The successful x-vector architecture is a time delay
                            neural network that applies statistics pooling to project variable-length
                            utterances into fixed-length speaker characterizing embeddings. In this paper,
                            we propose multiple enhancements to this architecture based on recent trends in
                            the related fields of face verification and computer vision. Firstly, the
                            initial frame layers can be restructured into 1-dimensional Res(2)Net modules
                            with impactful skip connections. Similarly to SE-ResNet, we introduce
                            Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks in these modules to explicitly model channel
                            interdependencies. The SE block expands the temporal context of the frame layer
                            by rescaling the channels according to global properties of the recording.
                            Secondly, neural networks are known to learn hierarchical features, with each
                            layer operating on a different level of complexity. To leverage this
                            complementary information, we aggregate and propagate features of different
                            hierarchical levels. Finally, we improve the statistics pooling module with
                            channel-dependent frame attention. This enables the network to focus on
                            different subsets of frames during each of the channel's statistics estimation.
                            The proposed ECAPA-TDNN architecture significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
                            TDNN based systems on the VoxCeleb test sets and the 2019 VoxCeleb Speaker

                            Data augmentation is one of the most effective ways to make end-to-end
                            automatic speech recognition (ASR) perform close to the conventional hybrid
                            approach, especially when dealing with low-resource tasks. Using recent
                            advances in speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), we build our TTS system
                            on an ASR training database and then extend the data with synthesized speech to
                            train a recognition model. We argue that, when the training data amount is low,
                            this approach can allow an end-to-end model to reach hybrid systems' quality.
                            For an artificial low-resource setup, we compare the proposed augmentation with
                            the semi-supervised learning technique. We also investigate the influence of
                            vocoder usage on final ASR performance by comparing Griffin-Lim algorithm with
                            our modified LPCNet. An external language model allows our approach to reach
                            the quality of a comparable supervised setup and outperform a semi-supervised
                            setup (both on test-clean). We establish a state-of-the-art result for
                            end-to-end ASR trained on LibriSpeech train-clean-100 set with WER 4.3% on
                            test-clean and 13.5% on test-other.

                            We present a novel deep compression algorithm to reduce the memory footprint
                            of LiDAR point clouds. Our method exploits the sparsity and structural
                            redundancy between points to reduce the bitrate. Towards this goal, we first
                            encode the LiDAR points into an octree, a data-efficient structure suitable for
                            sparse point clouds. We then design a tree-structured conditional entropy model
                            that models the probabilities of the octree symbols to encode the octree into a
                            compact bitstream. We validate the effectiveness of our method over two
                            large-scale datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the
                            bitrate by 10-20% at the same reconstruction quality, compared to the previous
                            state-of-the-art. Importantly, we also show that for the same bitrate, our
                            approach outperforms other compression algorithms when performing downstream 3D
                            segmentation and detection tasks using compressed representations. Our
                            algorithm can be used to reduce the onboard and offboard storage of LiDAR
                            points for applications such as self-driving cars, where a single vehicle
                            captures 84 billion points per day
